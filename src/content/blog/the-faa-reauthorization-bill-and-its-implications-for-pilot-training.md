The FAA reauthorization bill is currently being debated in Congress, and it has the potential to have a significant impact on pilot training. The bill includes provisions that would affect the 1500 hour requirement and retirement ages for commercial pilots.

The 1500 hour rule is a federal aviation regulation that requires pilots to have at least 1500 hours of flight time before they can be hired as a first officer for a commercial airline. The rule was put in place in 2013 in response to the Colgan Air Flight 3407 crash, which killed 50 people. There are pilots that sit on both ends of the debate. Some of the arguments for and against changes to the 1500 hour rule include:

## Arguments for changing the 1500 hour rule

- The 1500 hour rule is a barrier to entry for aspiring pilots, and it makes it more difficult for airlines to find qualified pilots.
- The rule does not necessarily ensure that pilots are more experienced or safer.
- Simulators can provide valuable training that can help pilots to develop the skills they need to fly safely.

Faye Malarkey Black, CEO of the Regional Airline Association, says that "Today's flight time requirements have no stipulations or associated training, and this flight time is accumulated after pilots complete training. These flight hours are unsupervised and unstructured, taking place in aircraft and environments that are nothing like commercial flying, where pilots have no opportunity to practice relevant skills.

## Arguments against changing the 1500 hour rule

- The 1500 hour rule is important for safety.
- Reducing the number of flight hours required could lead to less experienced pilots in the cockpit.
- Increasing the mandatory retirement age could force some experienced pilots to retire before they are ready.

Committee member Tammy Duckworth, who flew helicopters in the Iraq war, used harsh language to describe the changing the 1500 hour requirement during a speech on the Senate floor.

"A vote to reduce the 1,500 hour rule for pilot training will mean blood on your hands when the inevitable accident occurs as a result of an inadequately trained flight crew," she said, adding that it was 10 years of flying that enabled her to survive an incident in which her helicopter was hit by a rocket-propelled grenade.

## Proposed Changes to Pilot Requirements

The debate over the 1500 hour rule is likely to continue for some time. It is a complex issue with no easy answers, and it is important to consider all of the arguments before making a decision. So any changes to the rule is going to be met with scrutiny. As the FAA reauthorization bill goes through the legislative branch of our government, there are already changes being proposed.

One of the most significant changes in the bill would allow aspiring pilots to obtain up to 250 hours of the flight hours they must accrue in order to fly for a commercial airline on a simulator, up from the current cap of 100 hours. This would make it easier for pilots to get qualified, but some safety advocates worry that it could reduce the amount of real world flying experience that pilots get.

The bill would also increase the mandatory retirement age for commercial pilots from the current 65 to 67. This would help to address the shortage of pilots that is currently facing the industry. However, it this is just kicking the can down the road and extending the mandatory retirement age doesn't actually fix any of the deep rooted problems faced in the pilot shortage.

The final version of the FAA reauthorization bill is still being negotiated, and it is not yet clear when it will be passed or what changes will be finalized. However, the provisions related to pilot training are likely to be a major point of contention, and it will be interesting to see how the issue is ultimately resolved.

## What does this mean for flight schools?

The FAA reauthorization bill will have a significant impact on flight schools. If the bill is passed in its current form, it would make it easier for aspiring pilots to get qualified, which would then potentially lead to an increase in enrollment at flight schools. However, the bill could also lead to an increase in the cost of pilot training, as flight schools would need to invest in new simulators, planes, and infrastructure. In addition, with the current number of flight schools, the increased demand could potentially drive flight training prices up.

It is still too early to say what the long term impact of the FAA reauthorization bill will be on flight schools. However, it is clear that the bill has the potential to significantly change the landscape of pilot training.

## How can flight schools prepare for the changes?

Flight schools that want to be prepared for the changes brought about by the FAA reauthorization bill should start planning now. Here are a few things that flight schools can do:

- Invest in new simulators. If the bill is passed in its current form, flight schools might find it competitive to offer simulator training.
- Review their curriculums. Flight schools should review their curriculums to make sure that they are up-to-date with the latest changes.
- Market their services. Flight schools should start marketing their services to potential students now, in order to take advantage of the upcoming increase in enrollment.

The FAA reauthorization bill is still being debated, but it is clear that it has the potential to significantly change the landscape of pilot training. Flight schools that want to be prepared for the changes should start planning now.
