Right Rudder Marketing is excited to be attending the first ever King Schools EDU CON Aviation Symposium in San Diego. The event is coming this September 21 to 22nd in San Diego's Coast Air Center at Montgomery field. We'll be out there exhibiting Right Rudder Marketing and our [Flight School Marketing System](https://rightruddermarketing.com/marketing-system). In addition, we're going to be sponsoring door prizes and giving a small presentation on how our marketing system has helped flight schools across the country reach more students and grow their schools.

The Aviation Education Symposium is the first ever for King Schools and it aims to provide a platform for aviation professionals from across the country to exchange ideas and experiences. The event marks the commencement of a year long celebration of John and Martha King's fifty year contribution to aviation education. Originating as ground school instructors, the Kings have established a global enterprise in video and online instruction, benefiting countless pilots and aviation experts in achieving their aviation goals.

The symposium will feature presentations by John and Martha King themselves. Also presenting will be Barry Knuttila, CEO of King Schools, FAA Designated Pilot Examiners Mary Schu and Roger, long time aviation educator Brian Hough, and along with several other specialists. Topics on the agenda include enhancing FAA exam and check ride pass rates, addressing the A&P shortage, the airline career trajectory, strategies for students to excel in it, and pathways and methods for entrepreneurship in aviation education.

Participation, by invitation, is free for representatives of flight schools, college, and university aviation departments. Beyond offering a unique avenue for networking and idea exchange with colleagues and vendors, the symposium delivers pragmatic insights from John and Martha King on two crucial aspects affecting flight schools and aviation departments. These aspects are enhancing General Aviation safety — given the stagnation in accident rates following a prolonged decline — and training new pilots to cultivate the discernment characteristic of seasoned aviators.

The symposium presents an excellent opportunity for aviation educators nationwide to convene, exchange knowledge, and establish connections with peers. It offers a wealth of insights and experiences for attendees and facilitates interaction with fellow aviation education professionals. Right after the event is MCAS Miramar's annual air show on the weekend of the 23rd and 24th and accessible visits to the World War II aircraft carrier Midway.
