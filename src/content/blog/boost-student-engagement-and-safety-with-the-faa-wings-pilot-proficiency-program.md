### What Is the FAA WINGS Program?

The FAA WINGS (Pilot Proficiency) Program is a voluntary, structured initiative created by the Federal Aviation Administration to help pilots remain current, competent, and confident. Grounded in real-world scenarios and recurrent training, the WINGS program provides a scalable path to ongoing proficiency.

WINGS is organized into three progressive levels—Basic, Advanced, and Master—each with multiple phases. As pilots complete activities across knowledge and flight areas, they move up through the levels at their own pace. One of the biggest incentives? Completing any WINGS phase fulfills the Flight Review requirement under 14 CFR § 61.56.

### Why Should Flight Schools Care?

#### 1. Differentiate Your Training Program

Incorporating WINGS into your training curriculum signals to students and parents that your flight school prioritizes excellence. It shows that you're not only committed to student success but also aligned with FAA best practices. This added layer of structure and professionalism positions your program as best-in-class.

#### 2. Increase Retention and Engagement

WINGS provides students with a sense of momentum. With clear benchmarks, progress tracking, and FAA-endorsed recognition, students remain motivated and less likely to abandon training. The structured approach improves accountability while encouraging ongoing participation.

#### 3. Strengthen Community and Loyalty

The WINGS program is the foundation for building a connected, thriving aviation community. Hosting safety seminars, promoting peer achievement, and encouraging alumni participation through advanced ratings keeps your school top-of-mind and deeply relevant long after initial certifications are earned.

#### 4. Align with FAA and Industry Best Practices

When your flight school promotes WINGS, you're not just following safety guidelines—you’re championing them. This proactive stance resonates with regulators, insurers, and partners alike. It adds weight to your reputation and can lead to new opportunities, strategic alliances, and even funding support.

### How to Integrate WINGS into Your Flight School

- **Train Your Instructors**: Get your CFIs up to speed on WINGS so they can guide students through enrolling, tracking, and completing relevant activities.
- **Promote Consistently**: Include WINGS in your website copy, discovery flight materials, enrollment forms, and social media content. Let prospective students know about the added value your school offers.
- **Host Safety Events**: Organize FAASTeam seminars, webinars, and workshops that provide WINGS credit. These events not only draw attention to your school but foster stronger student and alumni engagement.
- **Celebrate Achievements**: Recognize students who complete WINGS phases with social media shoutouts, newsletters, or lobby boards. Celebrating progress encourages others to participate.
- **Leverage It in Your Marketing**: Showcasing your connection to the FAA WINGS Program enhances your authority. Add it to brochures, video marketing, and digital ads. It’s a selling point that sets you apart.
