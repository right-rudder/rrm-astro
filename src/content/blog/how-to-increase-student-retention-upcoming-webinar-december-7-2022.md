title: "Webinar: Formulating a captivating one liner to clarify your message"
description: In talking to a recent CFI candidate, my attention was brought to flight instructor responsibility and professionalism as a PTS item that must be reviewed for the checkride. It had been a while since I had thought about it. I know I discussed it during my own checkride prep, and when I was a freshly minted instructor I remember thinking about it directly far more often."

Our very first episode! We're going to be presenting our webinar on LinkedIn Events. During the webinar we'll look at correctly formulating a one liner to clarify your flight school's message. A one liner is a small one to two sentence catch phrase that businesses use to promote their brand. We'll look into what makes a great one liner that enlightens and captivates your customers and also look at one liners that don't perform well and confuse your customers. Looking forward to seeing you all there! Attend by clicking [here](https://www.linkedin.com/events/webinar-formulatingacaptivating7005681267363000320/comments/).
