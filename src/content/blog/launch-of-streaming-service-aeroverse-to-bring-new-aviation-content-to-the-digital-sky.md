There’s a new way to watch all things that fly…and its coming to a digital streaming service Dec. 17. Aeroverse has announced it will deliver aviation and aerospace content for serious aviators and aviation enthusiasts alike. Charles Cook, CEO has brought together an executive team with streaming service acumen as well as well-known content companies and creators. From social influencers to historical documentaries, Cook says his digital service will offer a unique blend of TV series, documentaries, and original content tailored for this unique and growing community.

Making this announcement from his hangar on his private airport, [Flying Oaks Airport (2TE2)](https://www.globalair.com/airport/flying-oaks-2te2.aspx), located just outside Ft. Worth, Texas, Cook made it clear that he already has content ready to broadcast. At a price tag of $8.99 per month, this digital streaming service will offer ad-free content like TV series, documentaries and exclusive original programming.

The platform will also feature celebrated personalities from popular YouTube channels such as Mike Patey, Josh Flowers (Aviation 101), Chelsea Smith (Aviation 101), Kristoffer Patasnik (Baron Pilot), Dan Millican (In The Hangar), and the skilled pilots of Just Planes. Cook shared that he’s already established a strategic partnership with AOPA and is offering discounts and special programming to its members.

Cook chose to launch the digital entertainment service on Dec. 17 as it is the 120th anniversary of the Wright Brothers’ pioneering flight in Kill Devil Hills, NC. Surrounded by his team, Cook shared their skills and experiences in the streaming space with hits like Ride TV will resonate with the aviation and aerospace community.

In August, Cook won a lawsuit that was filed in 2021 against Dan Gryder in excess of $1 million for harassment and slander for alleged activities at Cook’s business and airport. Cook appears to have put that behind him with this new venture.

“The Aeroverse platform aims to kindle a passion with quality, family-friendly content, entirely ad-free," he said. "Aeroverse isn’t just about entertainment; it’s an educational journey, sharing the marvels pilots experience daily.”
