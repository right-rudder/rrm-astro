Right Rudder Marketing, a leading digital marketing agency specializing in the aviation and flight school industry, is proud to announce the release of Tim Jedrek’s first book, The Flight School Handbook of Marketing Knowledge. This book is designed to equip flight school owners with practical marketing strategies to increase enrollments, enhance online presence, and grow their businesses.
Tim Jedrek, the founder of Right Rudder Marketing is an aviation marketing expert and pilot. He has dedicated years to developing successful digital marketing strategies for flight schools across the United States. His new book offers an extensive, yet digestible, breakdown of these methods, making it an essential resource for flight school owners who want to boost their visibility and student enrollment. Available now on Amazon, this handbook provides a step-by-step guide to digital marketing specifically tailored for flight schools.

The Flight School Handbook of Marketing Knowledge addresses the unique challenges flight schools face when promoting their services. Jedrek’s approach is built on his firsthand experience helping aviation schools improve their online marketing efforts. The book covers a wide array of topics, including search engine optimization (SEO), pay-per-click (PPC) advertising, social media campaigns, email marketing, and website optimization. These proven methods have been used to drive enrollments and profitability for flight schools nationwide.

Flight school owners will learn how to build an effective online presence by optimizing their websites for higher search rankings and lead conversion. The book also details how to utilize SEO to attract prospective pilots by creating high-quality, targeted content. Jedrek explains how to execute successful PPC campaigns using Google Ads and social media, ensuring effective budget management and audience targeting. Readers will also gain insight into creating and managing email marketing campaigns to nurture leads and convert inquiries into long-term students.

Additionally, the book provides real-world case studies and examples from Right Rudder Marketing’s client base, demonstrating how flight schools have implemented these strategies with measurable success. These examples serve as a guide for flight school owners looking to replicate these results in their own marketing efforts.
Tim Jedrek’s handbook is designed to be practical and results-driven. Rather than offering theoretical concepts, Jedrek’s book provides clear, actionable strategies that flight school owners can begin implementing immediately. The book includes everything from building an online presence to managing the conversion process, giving school owners a complete roadmap to improving their marketing efforts and growing their student base.

The book showcases the Flight School Marketing System that has been applied to flight schools of all sizes, with measurable growth in leads, student retention, and local presence. Jedrek emphasizes the importance of structured, results-oriented marketing strategies in helping flight schools thrive in a competitive industry. In discussing the motivations behind the book, Jedrek said,
“I wanted to help flight schools enroll more student pilots and grow their aviation businesses faster than ever before to help keep up with the ever-increasing student pilot demand.”
