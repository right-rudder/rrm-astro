Right Rudder Marketing is committed to helping flight schools grow their student bodies and capture more revenue in the competitive aviation training market. It’s for that reason that we have partnered with the Flight School Association of North America to reach more flight schools across the United States.

We will be a sponsor of this event and look forward to such a powerful gathering of flight school owners, CFIs, students, and aviation enthusiasts in Las Vegas, Nevada, at Caesar’s Palace from February 21-23, 2024.

## What to Expect from FSANA 2024

The **[FSANA 2024 Trade Show](https://www.fsana.com/registration_details.php)** is a unique opportunity for flight schools and aviation enthusiasts alike.
