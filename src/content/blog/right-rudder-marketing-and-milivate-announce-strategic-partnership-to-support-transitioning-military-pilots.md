**Right Rudder Marketing** (RRM), a leader in aviation marketing solutions, is excited to announce a strategic partnership with Milivate, a premier organization dedicated to helping transitioning service members successfully integrate into civilian careers. This collaboration aims to leverage RRM’s marketing expertise to broaden Milivate’s reach and enhance opportunities for military pilots transitioning to civilian roles.

The aviation industry is currently facing a significant pilot shortage, creating a pressing need for skilled professionals. Military pilots, with their extensive training, discipline, and adaptability, are uniquely positioned to fill this gap. The partnership between **Right Rudder Marketing** and Milivate is designed to capitalize on this potential by promoting the Department of Defense’s SkillBridge program, which facilitates the transition of service members into civilian employment.

The SkillBridge program is an innovative initiative that connects transitioning service members with civilian employers. During a trial period of up to six months, the Department of Defense covers the service members' salaries, allowing employers to evaluate the fit and skill set of potential employees without financial risk. This arrangement provides invaluable civilian work experience for veterans while offering businesses access to a pool of highly trained and motivated candidates at no cost.

## RRM and Milivate's Partnership

**Right Rudder Marketing** will bring its expertise in aviation marketing to the partnership, creating targeted campaigns aimed at both employers and service members. These campaigns will highlight the unique advantages of hiring military pilots and showcase the benefits of the SkillBridge program. By increasing awareness and participation in the program, RRM and Milivate hope to make a significant impact on the aviation industry and the careers of transitioning military pilots.

The partnership is poised to bring numerous benefits to the aviation industry. Flight schools and other aviation businesses will have the opportunity to host skilled military pilots as part of their teams, allowing for thorough training and evaluation without the financial burden of salaries. This initiative aims to address the pilot shortage while providing veterans with invaluable civilian work experience.

## What Does This Mean for Military Pilots?

For military pilots, the SkillBridge program offers a smooth transition into civilian careers. The program provides them with the opportunity to apply their skills in a new context, gain valuable work experience, and build connections in the civilian aviation industry. The support and resources provided by Milivate ensure that service members are well-prepared for their new roles, enhancing their prospects for long-term success.

To discuss the details of this partnership and its implications, Milivate will be featured on the **Right Rudder Marketing** podcast on July 2. Listeners can expect an in-depth conversation about the benefits of the SkillBridge program and the positive impact it will have on the aviation industry. This podcast episode will provide valuable insights for employers, service members, and anyone interested in the future of aviation.
