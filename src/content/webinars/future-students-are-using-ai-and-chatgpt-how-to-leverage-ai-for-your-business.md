Future pilots are already asking AI tools like ChatGPT which flight school they should choose—and the schools that understand this shift will win the enrollment game.
In this webinar, RRM Founder Tim Jedrek will show flight school and aviation business owners how prospective students are using AI tools (ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini, Meta AI, etc.) to research training options long before they ever land on your website. You will learn how this behavior is changing the traditional marketing funnel and what that means for your lead flow, branding, and enrollment strategy in 2026 and beyond.
