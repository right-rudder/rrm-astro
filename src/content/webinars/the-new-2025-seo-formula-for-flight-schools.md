## How to Be Found in the Age of AI

**The rules of digital visibility have changedâ€”and your flight school must evolve or risk getting left behind.**

If you're still relying solely on traditional SEO to attract student pilots, you're missing a rapidly growing opportunity. AI platforms like ChatGPT, Google Gemini, and Meta AI are now go-to tools for students researching flight training options.

Welcome to **GEO: Generative Engine Optimization**â€”the next frontier in online visibility.

GEO is the process of optimizing your flight schoolâ€™s online presence to ensure it gets recommended by AI engines. This includes everything from Google Search to AI chatbots and generative platforms. GEO stands for **Generative Engine Optimization** and is the new frontier in digital marketing.
In our recent webinar, Tim Jedrek, Right Rudder Marketing's Director of SEO, shared the latest strategies to ensure your flight school is found in both traditional search engines and AI-powered platforms.

## What Is GEO and Why It Matters for Your School

While SEO helps your school rank in Google search results, **GEO ensures your school gets recommended by AI-powered tools** when prospective students ask questions like, "What's the best flight school near me?"

These AI engines pull from the **same core data signals** that fuel traditional SEOâ€”including website structure, relevance, reviews, and authority.

If you're already doing strong SEO, you're halfway there. But thriving in 2025 demands a system that supports both SEO and GEO success.
