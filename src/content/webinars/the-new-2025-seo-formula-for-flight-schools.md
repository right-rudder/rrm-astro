# The NEW 2025 SEO / GEO (Generative AI) Formula for Flight Schools  
### How to Get Your Flight School Aviation Business on the Top of Google Search and in AI (ChatGPT, etc.) Responses

> **Live Webinar – Thursday, April 24 at 2 PM Central**  
> Hosted by Tim Jedrek | Right Rudder Marketing

## Why This Webinar Matters

Search is changing. Your flight school can no longer rely on just showing up in Google search results. In 2025, prospective students are also using ChatGPT, Claude, Grok, and Gemini to get answers and recommendations — and flight schools that don’t optimize for this *new wave of AI results* are falling behind.

That’s where **GEO** — Generative Engine Optimization — comes in.

This free webinar will break down our proven SEO + GEO formula for 2025, used by some of the fastest-growing flight schools in the country. Whether you're running a Part 61 or 141 program, you'll walk away with real strategies to boost online visibility and student inquiries.

## What You'll Learn

- **How AI changes the SEO game** – Why Google isn’t the only platform that matters anymore
- **What is GEO and why it’s the next big thing** – How to rank in ChatGPT, Claude, Grok, Gemini, and other AI tools
- **Live SEO teardown** – We'll review a few flight school websites and show what’s working (and what’s not)
- **2025 local SEO tactics** – Make sure you're found in “flight school near me” searches in your area
- **Content strategies that actually convert** – Blog posts, YouTube, and landing pages built for both search and AI

## Who Should Attend

- Flight school owners and managers
- Marketing teams in aviation training
- CFIs looking to help their schools grow
- Anyone who handles a school’s website, SEO, or lead generation
