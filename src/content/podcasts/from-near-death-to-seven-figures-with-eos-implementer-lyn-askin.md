## Episode Overview

In this powerful episode of the Aviation Business Podcast, host Tim Jedrek sits down with Lyn Askin, a certified EOS (Entrepreneurial Operating System) implementer and serial entrepreneur who turned a near-death experience into a complete business transformation. After suffering a massive pulmonary embolism in 2020, Lyn discovered that his business would have died with him‚Äîa wake-up call that led him to implement EOS and ultimately 3x his revenue, 7x his profits, and successfully exit his 26-year-old marketing agency.

## What You'll Learn

- **The True Cost of Being "Good at Something"**: Why most entrepreneurs build businesses that run them instead of the other way around
- **The Six Key Components of Business Success**: Vision, People, Data, Issues, Process, and Traction‚Äîand how strengthening just these six areas can solve your 136 simultaneous problems
- **The VTO (Vision Traction Organizer)**: A two-page business plan that answers the eight essential questions every business owner must address
- **The Level 10 Meeting Framework**: A proven 90-minute weekly meeting structure that keeps your team aligned and executing
- **Core Values That Actually Matter**: How to use core values for hiring, firing, reviewing, and rewarding (not just as wall decorations)
- **The Right People, Right Seats Philosophy**: A framework for objectively evaluating team members and making tough personnel decisions

## Key Takeaways

### 1. Vision Without Traction Is Hallucination

Many business owners have big dreams but lack the discipline and accountability to execute. EOS provides a systematic framework for bringing your vision down to ground level and making it reality‚Äî90 days at a time.

### 2. The Problem With "Winging It"

Most entrepreneurs started their business because they were good at something‚Äînot because they were good at running a business. Without a system, you'll keep hitting ceilings and feeling like your business controls you.

### 3. The Power of Weekly Discipline

The Level 10 Meeting structure includes:

- **5 minutes**: Personal and professional wins (building team trust)
- **5 minutes**: Scorecard review (running on real data)
- **5 minutes**: Rock check-in (quarterly priorities)
- **5 minutes**: Customer/employee headlines
- **5 minutes**: To-do list review
- **60 minutes**: IDS (Identify, Discuss, Solve) your biggest issues
- **5 minutes**: Conclude and rate the meeting

### 4. Core Values Are Your Hiring and Firing Guide

Core values aren't just feel-good statements‚Äîthey define what it means to be a good employee at your company. Use them to:

- Hire people who fit your culture
- Fire people who don't (without guilt)
- Review and reward team members objectively
- Recognize achievements in meaningful ways

### 5. Rocks Keep You Moving Forward

A "rock" is your biggest priority for the next 90 days. By setting 3-7 company rocks each quarter, you ensure consistent progress. As EOS founder Gino Wickman said when asked how he'd reach 10,000 clients: "90 days at a time."
