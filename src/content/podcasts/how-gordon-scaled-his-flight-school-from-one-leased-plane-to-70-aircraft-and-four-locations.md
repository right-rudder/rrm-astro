Gordon Alvord took Rainier Flight Service from a single leased aircraft to a multi-location flight school with over 70 planes. In this episode, he shares the real challenges and growing pains of scaling operations, managing fleet expansion, and maintaining quality across multiple locations. And how he made it to where he is now running a highly successful flight school.

Beyond growth, Gordon developed an in-house software tool to streamline flight school operations—one he’s now making available to others. We’ll discuss the problems this tool solves and how technology can help flight schools improve efficiency and profitability. If you're looking to scale your flight school the right way, don’t miss this conversation.

We'll be streaming this on our Youtube channel, LinkedIn, and Twitter as well as Tim Jedrek's Facebook. You can also participate and join the live audience on Riverside.
