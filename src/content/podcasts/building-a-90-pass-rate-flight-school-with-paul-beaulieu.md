Here's something that keeps most flight school owners up at night: about 80% of students who start flight training never finish. That's not just a statistic—it represents thousands of dreams deferred and millions in lost revenue across our industry.

But what if your flight school could flip that script?

Paul Beaulieu, founder and Chief Flight Instructor of AVIER Flight School, has done exactly that. He's built a flight school with a 90% first-time checkride pass rate, with students completing their certificates close to the FAA's 40-hour minimum. And he's doing it while running a growing operation with 7 instructors, 8 aircraft, and 95 active students.

We're thrilled to announce that Paul is joining us for a live recording of The Aviation Business Podcast, and you're invited to be part of the conversation.

**When:** December 8, 2025
**Time:** 9:00 AM CST

## Why This Conversation Matters to You

Whether you're running an established flight school or just starting out, Paul's journey offers real-world insights you can actually use. Since founding AVIER in 2014 at Beverly Municipal Airport (KBVY) in Massachusetts, he's grown from a single instructor with one airplane to one of New England's most efficient flight training operations.

With over 6,000 flight hours and more than 14 years as an FAA Safety Team Representative, Paul brings both the operational experience and the teaching expertise that make his approach work. His background as a former public school teacher and administrator gives him a unique perspective on instructional design that most CFIs never develop.

## What You'll Learn

### How Scenario-Based Training Actually Reduces Flight Hours

Paul made the shift from traditional maneuver-based instruction to scenario-based training (SBT), and it's been fundamental to his students' success. But here's the thing—lots of schools talk about SBT without really implementing it effectively.

We'll dig into Paul's specific strategies for making scenario-based training work in real operations. Research consistently shows that SBT enhances pilot decision-making by exposing students to situations that require quick thinking and sound judgment. The result? Safer, more competent pilots who actually finish their training.

### The Ground School Philosophy That Changes Everything

Paul operates on a principle that might sound counterintuitive: "learning to fly is best done on the ground." His generous briefing times and thorough ground instruction actually reduce the total flight hours students need for certification.

Think about that for a moment. More ground time equals fewer flight hours, lower costs for students, and better pass rates. We'll explore how this philosophy impacts both your students' success and your school's bottom line.

### Making Flight Simulation Technology Work for Your School

As aircraft availability becomes more challenging and costs continue rising, Paul's integration of flight simulators for multi-engine and instrument training offers a practical solution. He'll share how he's using simulation to enhance training quality while managing operational costs—not as a gimmick, but as a genuine tool for better outcomes.

### Building an Instructor Team That Retains Students

Here's something we don't talk about enough: students are more likely to stick with training when they believe their instructor is genuinely invested in their success, not just building hours for the airlines. Paul's experience in education gives him unique insights into creating a coaching culture among CFIs.

We'll discuss how he structures his instructor team, develops their teaching skills, and creates an environment where students feel supported through the challenging moments of flight training.

## Why Marketing and Operations Go Hand in Hand

Let's be honest—a 90% first-time pass rate isn't just an operational win. It's one of the most powerful marketing differentiators you could have in today's competitive landscape.

When prospective students are researching flight schools, they're making a significant financial and time commitment. They're looking for proof that your school can deliver results. Measurable outcomes like reduced training times and higher pass rates establish the trust and authority that turns prospects into enrolled students.
