_A conversation with Avier Flight School's founder reveals the power of hospitality-driven aviation training and strategic growth_

Building a successful flight school doesn't require massive startup capital or outside investors. It requires vision, dedication, and a willingness to create something truly different. Paul Beaulieu, co-founder of [Avier Flight School](https://avierflight.com/) in Beverly, Massachusetts, has proven this by growing from a single leased aircraft to a thriving operation with 12 airplanes, 20+ instructors, and 200-250 active students, generating nearly $2 million annually.

In a recent episode of the [Aviation Business Podcast](/podcast) hosted by Right Rudder Marketing's Tim Jedrek, Paul shared the remarkable journey of building Avier Flight School and the unconventional strategies that set his operation apart from traditional flight training providers.

## The Humble Beginnings: Starting With What You Have

Paul's aviation career began 27 years ago while working as a public school teacher and administrator. After becoming a flight instructor and accumulating over 7,000 hours of dual instruction given, he made the leap to open his own school in 2015. Originally called Perception Prime (derived from the FAA's "Perceive, Process, Perform" model), the school started without significant capital investment.

"I was a guy who has a flight instructor certificate and I didn't have an office but I was able to grab an office. I didn't have an airplane and I couldn't afford one," Paul explained in the podcast.

His solution? Leaseback aircraft.

### The Leaseback Strategy: A Low-Risk Entry Point

For flight school owners considering expansion or just starting out, Paul's leaseback model offers valuable insights. His first aircraft came from a student who agreed to purchase a plane and lease it to the school, using it for personal flying when not scheduled for training.

"Leasing was the only way to start for us," Paul noted. "It protected me from a lot of the investment that I would have had to have made and frankly some of the planning I would have had to have made."

As the business gained traction and customer demand grew, Paul strategically transitioned from purely leaseback to a mixed fleet model. In 2024, Avier purchased its first brand-new Piper Archer from the factory. That milestone represented the school's maturation and financial stability.

**Key takeaway for flight school owners:** Leaseback arrangements allow you to test market demand and build operational systems before committing significant capital to aircraft ownership. Once you've established consistent revenue and proven your training model, transitioning to owned aircraft increases profit margins and operational control.

## The American Dream Partnership: From Piano Student to Co-Owner

Perhaps the most remarkable aspect of Avier's story is how Paul found his business partner. Esteban Monterroso first met Paul not at an airport, but in a music classroom 17 years ago.

"I was a school teacher, music teacher, and administrator," Paul explained. "Esteban was just a young kid from Colombia sitting in my classroom and I asked him, 'What do you want to do when you grow up?' And he says, 'Mr, I want to be a pilot.' And I said, 'You're kidding me, I'm a flight instructor.'"

When Paul opened the school, Esteban came aboard immediately to help run the office. After several years of working together, Paul recognized Esteban's deep understanding of the business culture and made a bold decision: he offered him 50% ownership.

"At some point I say to myself, well, you know, this kid is going through his 20s toward 30. At some point he's gonna go get a real job... I can't let that happen," Paul recalled. "So I threw down the paperwork and said, 'The company's yours, I work for you now. Let's do this 50-50.'"

The partnership has been transformational. Tim Jedrek noted in the podcast that meeting Esteban left a strong impression: "His presence when I met him, his overall energy... I could feel like, okay, this guy knows what he's talking about."

**Marketing insight:** This partnership story is itself powerful marketing content. The narrative of the American dream (a young immigrant becoming a flight school co-owner) resonates emotionally with prospective students and creates a distinctive brand identity. Flight schools should identify and share their own unique founding stories through and social media.

## The Maslow-Driven Flight School: Rethinking the Student Experience

What truly differentiates Avier from traditional flight schools is Paul's application of Abraham Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs to flight training. He calls this concept "The Avier Wave."

### Level 1: Physiological Needs

"First of all, I'll point out this is a Maslow-driven flight school," Paul explained. "Abraham Maslow's Hierarchy of Human Needs, his pyramid starts with physiological."

At Avier, this means:

- A chef on staff serving hot meals daily
- An extensive beverage menu including cappuccino, espresso, Turkish coffee, herbal teas, and specialty hot chocolate
- Comfortable furniture and environment
- Attention to physical comfort details

"Each of those beverages probably cost me about seven or eight cents," Paul noted. "But flying's expensive. I'm taking in plenty of these people's money."

### Level 2: Safety Beyond the Cockpit

The second layer addresses safety, not just physical safety in the aircraft, but psychological safety in the learning environment.

"Safety not just that they're not going to die in an airplane today, but safety that someone who looks or feels different than me will feel safe to come in and say, 'Hey, I'd like to be part of this community too,'" Paul emphasized.

Many prospective pilots face intimidation when entering aviation, particularly those from underrepresented backgrounds or non-traditional aviation families. Paul intentionally creates an inclusive environment where everyone feels welcome.

Tim shared his own experience: "I'm a brown guy... I had to shop around for a few flight schools before I found one I felt at home. Some schools... it wasn't even the staff. It was actually the students, the other classmates that made me personally feel like I wasn't at their level yet."

Creating psychological safety requires intention. Paul advises: "You have to do everything on purpose and you have to really see things from your customer's eyes. Empathy is an intelligence, a form of intelligence."

### Level 3: Love and Belongingness

The third layer focuses on community and belonging. At Avier, this manifests through:

- Strong instructor mentorship programs
- Community events and gatherings
- A culture where students and instructors form genuine connections
- Home-growing instructors from within the student body

"If people's physiological needs are met and they're comfortable, then it's safety... If all of those elements of the pyramid are in place, the ego is intact, the client's ego is intact," Paul explained. "Self-actualization is what Maslow calls it, but success is possible if the person is built up, their ego is built up to be safe and supported and nurtured."

### The Safety Impact

This holistic approach has measurable safety benefits. Avier maintains a 90% checkride pass rate with average private pilot training times close to the 40-hour FAA minimum.

"That radically impacts aviation safety," Paul stated. "We create a truly immersive environment where when you're here around these airplanes, learning to fly them, you are 100% engaged."

**Marketing application:** Flight schools should showcase their unique culture and student experience through [video testimonials](/resources/video-production), facility tours, and behind-the-scenes content. Prospective students don't just buy flight training. They buy an experience and community. Make yours visible online through strategic [digital marketing](/flight-school-seo).

## The Critical Transition: From Instructor to CEO

One of the most challenging transitions for flight school owners is removing themselves from daily instruction to focus on business leadership and growth.

"At the beginning, I was the primary instructor. I have 7,000 hours of dual given, virtually mostly here at this flight school," Paul shared. "And then, as we start to get our third, fourth, fifth plus flight instructor, at that point I say to myself, put the brakes on. How safe is it to run this school?"

Paul recognized that having multiple instructors operating independently under one roof (each following their own methods) creates safety risks. His solution was to step out of the cockpit and into a leadership role focused on:

- **Standardization:** Creating SOPs and training protocols
- **Mentorship:** Developing instructors through consistent guidance
- **Quality control:** Monitoring instruction quality across the team
- **Culture building:** Ensuring every instructor embodies Avier's values

"I'm an educator from day one, I love to be a teacher and a leader. So I was in my happy place when I could be focusing on mentoring the other instructors. Creating paradigms, creating protocols, SOPs, everything to keep us all going the same direction," he explained.

Today, Paul has completely removed himself from daily operations. Avier now employs:

- A general manager
- Three office managers
- A maintenance manager
- A social media person
- A chef
- 20+ flight instructors

"My main job is doing this podcast and visiting with John and Martha [King] and attending as many, being involved in as many outside organizations as possible to bring the industry into our world," Paul said.

**Strategic advice:** If your flight school is stuck at 1-3 aircraft and under $500,000 in revenue, the likely bottleneck is your inability to remove yourself from daily instruction. Your highest-value activity as owner is business development, strategic planning, and building systems, not flying with every student.

## Building Your Leadership Team: Grow From Within

Rather than hiring experienced managers from outside, Paul advocates for home-growing leaders from your student and instructor base.

"Following the pathway that's in front of you... growing people from the inside," he advised. "Since this is a school, people come in with the desire to become a pilot, number one. They get ingrained into the culture that we have here, culture and community, that is key."

The benefits of internal development include:

- **Cultural alignment:** They already understand and embody your values
- **Loyalty:** They have personal investment in the school's success
- **Knowledge continuity:** They know your systems and processes
- **Authentic leadership:** They genuinely care about the mission

"Making someone a leader here at Avier is ensuring that they are deeply committed to the culture and that they feel ownership in the culture and that they will take very good care of our customers," Paul explained.

He also emphasized a critical leadership principle: "Organic matter rolls downhill. If you don't take good care of your people, they're not gonna take good care of your other people."

## The Hospitality Mindset: Lessons From Restaurant Management

Paul's background includes not just education and aviation, but also hospitality. He worked as a waiter and restaurant manager.

"The perfect storm of what makes Avier special is my multiple careers," he noted. "Hospitality is highly conspicuous when you walk through our door and it's a highly relevant aspect of the pilots that we turn out."

This hospitality focus produces pilots with strong customer service orientation, which is critical for those pursuing airline careers. "We turn out a CSR customer service rep pilot who is aware of the needs of the public and the needs of everyone around them," Paul said.

**Differentiation strategy:** Most flight schools compete on price, location, or fleet. Avier competes on _experience_, and that's difficult for competitors to replicate. Consider what unique background or expertise you bring that could differentiate your school. Then make that visible through [SEO-optimized content](/flight-school-seo) and strategic [online marketing](/how-to-enroll-more-students-with-google-ads-in-2024).

## The Sacrifices: What It Really Takes

Building a successful flight school requires sustained sacrifice. Paul was candid about the realities:

**Always-on availability:** "If I've got planes in the air, the phone ringer is always on. And that's pretty much overnight too. There's two or three planes up till after midnight."

**Minimal personal compensation initially:** It took years before Paul paid himself a meaningful salary. "I could still, and so I still as any business owner would, I still squeeze every penny that I can into the growth of the company."

**Living the business:** "I pretty much eat, drink, and everything but sleep here. It's more fun to see the money go into the business than into the bank account."

Paul also noted that being unencumbered helped: "It helps a lot being a single guy without a wife and kids to support. Having fewer responsibilities outside of the business that I'm trying to run and grow."

For those with families, Paul emphasized the importance of spousal support and family buy-in to the mission.

**Realistic expectations:** Tim Jedrek shared his own timeline: "For me personally, it took me about a year and a half, maybe two years I think before we started paying myself." Flight school owners should plan for 1-3 years of minimal personal income while building the business foundation.

## The Rebrand: From Perception Prime to Avier

After several years of operation, Paul decided to rebrand from Perception Prime to Avier.

"Perception Prime, while it spoke to my passion of education and perception, perceived process, perform... it was a little too out there. It didn't scream flight school. So Avier does a little more so," he explained.

The name Avier, with French derivation, was developed with professional marketing support. Paul worked with a marketing firm that researched options and presented three choices. Avier was the recommendation and "just really took."

**Branding lesson:** Your flight school name should be memorable, pronounceable, and clearly connected to aviation. If your current name creates confusion or doesn't resonate with your target market, rebranding may be worth the investment. Work with specialists who understand the [aviation industry](/about) to ensure your brand communicates effectively.

## Making the "Avier Wave" Famous

Paul's current primary objective is evangelizing Avier's approach to the broader aviation industry.

"If I look in the beginning of my planner, my annual goals, the first one is make the Avier Wave famous," he shared. "I believe in what we've created... I really think it helps to make the industry safer to do some of the things I'll discuss. And I really wanna get the word out there. I don't wanna hoard it."

This mission reflects Paul's educator background—a genuine desire to improve aviation training industry-wide, not just build his own business.

The "Avier Wave" encompasses:

- Maslow-driven student experience design
- Hospitality-first culture
- Scenario-based training philosophy
- Generous ground instruction and simulator time
- Inclusive, psychologically safe environment
- Home-grown instructor development

**Thought leadership strategy:** Established flight schools should consider how they can contribute to industry improvement through [content marketing](/blog), speaking engagements, and participation in aviation organizations. This positions your school as an authority and attracts students who want to learn from industry leaders.

Right Rudder Marketing can help you develop and distribute thought leadership content that establishes your school as the go-to aviation training authority in your market.
