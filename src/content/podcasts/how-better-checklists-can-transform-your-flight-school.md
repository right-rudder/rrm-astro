Running a flight school in 2026 isn't just about scheduling aircraft and coordinating instructors anymore. It's about creating experiences, solving problems creatively, and finding ways to work smarter instead of harder.

In our first Aviation Business Podcast episode of the year, Tim Jedrek sat down with Otto Mand, Director of Operations, IT, and Marketing at D&J Aviation in Central Florida. Otto also happens to be the founder of EZ Copilot, a company making innovative aviation checklists. Their conversation touched on everything from the daily chaos of flight school operations to the surprising realities of the new MOSAIC rule.

If you're a flight school owner trying to navigate today's competitive landscape, Otto's insights offer practical wisdom you can actually use. Here's what we learned.

## The "Director of Everything" Reality

Otto describes his role at D&J Aviation with a laugh: "Director of asterisk—director of anything."

Sound familiar? If you run a flight school, you know exactly what he means. You're the operations manager, the IT troubleshooter, the marketing director, the customer service rep, and sometimes even the janitor—all before lunch.

"Your day never ends," Otto admits. "My phone will forever be buzzing."

But here's the thing: within that chaos lies opportunity. The key is identifying which daily headaches can be automated, streamlined, or eliminated entirely.

### Working Smarter Through Automation

Otto's background spans aviation, IT, and marketing, which gives him a unique lens for spotting inefficiencies. "You're able to take kind of what happens in the day-to-day of the operation and then what areas can we streamline or make more efficient."

His advice for flight school owners? Prioritize automation wherever possible. Tools like Zapier, custom scripts, and integrated software solutions can handle the repetitive tasks that eat up your team's time. This frees everyone up to focus on what actually matters: teaching students to fly and building relationships.

If you're drowning in administrative work and aren't sure where to start with automation, [Right Rudder Marketing's consulting services](https://rightruddermarketing.com/) can help you identify digital solutions that complement both your marketing strategy and operational workflow.

## The 70/30 Truth Every New Student Needs to Hear

Here's something Otto emphasizes that every flight school should be communicating from day one: "Aviation is 70% studying and 30% flying."

Most new students walk in excited about the flying part. And yes, that's the fun part. But it's the knowledge component that determines whether they'll succeed or struggle.

Otto shared an eye-opening comparison: "Someone told me a couple years ago that learning to get your private pilot's license—just the meteorological aspect—is the equivalent to the first two years of getting your bachelor's degree in meteorology."

Let that sink in for a moment.

### Managing Expectations From Discovery Flight to Checkride

You've seen it happen. New students show up for their discovery flight with stars in their eyes. But around the 10-hour mark, reality sets in. They realize this isn't just about pulling back on the yoke and watching the ground fall away. There are regulations to memorize, weather patterns to understand, systems to study.

"Instructors can teach you how to fly," Otto notes, "but they can't force you to go home and put your head in a book."

The most successful students? They're the ones who immerse themselves completely. They're decoding METARs at breakfast, studying aerodynamics during lunch, and listening to ATC recordings before bed.

Flight schools that set these expectations early—during the initial consultation, in marketing materials, throughout the onboarding process—see significantly higher completion rates. Students who know what they're signing up for are students who stick around.

This is exactly the kind of messaging [Right Rudder Marketing specializes in creating](https://rightruddermarketing.com/blog)—content that's honest about the challenges while maintaining enthusiasm for the journey.

## Customer Experience: The Real Competitive Advantage

Central Florida is saturated with flight schools. So how does D&J Aviation stand out?

"When you walk through the hangar doors, immediately there's music playing," Otto explains. "Owen at the front desk will know your name if you've been there once or twice."

This isn't accidental. It's strategic.

In a market where many schools treat students like "number 17 off in one-two-three Alpha Bravo," personal attention becomes your differentiator.

### Building a Community, Not Just Checking Boxes

D&J Aviation's approach to customer experience includes:

**Personalized interactions** - Staff members know student names, goals, and what they're working toward. They remember whether you're training for an airline career or planning to fly your family on weekend trips.

**Welcoming environment** - Music creates energy. Hangar-based operations give students direct access to the aircraft. Every detail is designed to make people feel like they belong.

**Individual attention** - Understanding each student's unique situation and adapting the experience accordingly.

**Reasonable pricing** - Competitive rates without sacrificing quality. As Otto puts it: "We all understand there is a cost to aviation. Our prices are very reasonable, if not the most competitive in Central Florida."

Here's what makes D&J's approach particularly effective: everyone on the team is either a pilot or working toward their certificate. They understand the student experience from the inside.

This holistic approach directly impacts the two most important metrics for sustainable flight school growth: student retention and word-of-mouth referrals.

If you want to extend that positive customer experience from the first Google search through solo flight and beyond, [Right Rudder Marketing's digital strategies](https://rightruddermarketing.com/resources) can help you build systems that support your operational excellence.

## EZ Copilot: When Frustration Breeds Innovation

Sometimes the best businesses start with someone getting fed up with the status quo.

During instrument training, Otto encountered a problem that probably sounds familiar: existing checklists were hard to read in the cockpit, EZ to lose your place on, and didn't match his personal flows.

"I went home and made my own," he recalls. "I'll print it off on card stock. It'll be fine."

That homemade solution evolved into EZ Copilot, a business producing waterproof, durable, completely customizable checklists for pilots and flight schools.

### Built to Last (Almost Literally Bulletproof)

Otto spent over two years finding manufacturers capable of producing truly durable checklists. He tested them extensively. In one memorable incident, a checklist fell from his car trunk directly into the path of a lawnmower.

"I pulled it out and it was fine. It had a scratch, a scuff on the front, but it was still in one piece."

This durability factor solves a real problem in flight training. Those laminated checklists from aviation retailers often peel, crease, or become illegible after a few months of use—especially in humid climates or during hot summer operations.

### White-Label Solutions for Your Flight School

Here's where EZ Copilot becomes particularly relevant for flight school operators: the white-label customization option.

Schools can have checklists produced with their own branding, customized flows matching their specific aircraft and training procedures, and designed to align with local DPE expectations.

"We take our checklist and put whatever logo the flight school has," Otto explains. "We completely customize the flow specifically to whatever that flight school individually needs."

This creates a cohesive brand experience. Students see your logo on the aircraft, in the facility, on their training materials. It's a subtle but powerful reinforcement of your brand identity that complements your broader [marketing and branding strategy](https://rightruddermarketing.com/).

## MOSAIC: The Reality Behind the Hype

No aviation conversation in 2026 is complete without discussing MOSAIC. The FAA's modernization rule took effect for sport pilot privileges in October 2025, and there's been plenty of excitement about what it means for flight training.

Otto offers some valuable ground-level perspective based on his operational experience and conversations with Designated Pilot Examiners.

"Even DPEs are uncertain about it," Otto notes. "They're a little hesitant because it seemingly gives you the same private pilot requirements and abilities, just with the sport pilot training."

### The Training Hours Gap

Yes, MOSAIC significantly reduced minimum training hours for sport pilot certificates. But there's a critical gap between regulatory minimums and practical reality.

"Even though the hours are strictly reduced from the private pilot, students are still going to more or less have to meet the requirements of the private pilot."

Why? Because DPEs expect sport pilot applicants to perform at private pilot proficiency levels during checkrides. This means training hours often remain similar—typically 50 to 80 hours total time before students are checkride-ready, despite lower regulatory minimums.

### What This Means for Your Flight School

From an operations perspective, this creates a challenging value proposition.

"Our fees don't change. The planes are the same. The planes don't magically get reduced because the rating or license isn't necessarily as high," Otto explains practically.

If training costs remain comparable to private pilot certificates, the primary benefit narrows to students avoiding medical certification through driver's license medical privileges.

For flight schools, this means marketing MOSAIC carefully. Set accurate expectations about training duration and costs while highlighting the legitimate advantages for students who genuinely benefit from BasicMed-style medical privileges.

If you're navigating how to position MOSAIC training in your marketing, [Right Rudder Marketing can help develop messaging](https://rightruddermarketing.com/schedule-call) that's both compelling and honest.

## The Path Less Traveled: Aviation Careers Beyond the Airlines

One of the most valuable themes throughout the conversation is challenging the narrow perception of aviation careers.

"80% I'd say is airlines, maybe 19% is military. The 1% is what else—but it's not the reality," Tim notes, correcting a common misconception.

Otto's career path illustrates this perfectly. With a private pilot certificate and instrument rating, he's built a fulfilling aviation career in operations, IT, and business development. He never pursued ATP certification, yet he's deeply engaged in the industry every single day.

This message matters for flight schools. Many potential students assume they must commit to an airline career trajectory or shouldn't pursue training at all.

That's simply not true.

Aviation offers diverse opportunities in operations and management, marketing and business development, aircraft maintenance and avionics, aviation journalism and content creation, technology and software development, aircraft sales and brokerage, and aviation insurance and underwriting.

Flight schools that effectively communicate this career diversity can attract students who might otherwise overlook flight training. You're expanding your addressable market significantly.

## What Flight School Owners Can Take Away

Otto Mand's insights offer several actionable strategies:

**Automate relentlessly.** Identify manual processes consuming staff time and implement technological solutions. Your team should be teaching and building relationships, not drowning in paperwork.

**Invest in customer experience.** Know student names. Understand their goals. Create a community atmosphere. This drives retention and referrals more effectively than any discount.

**Set realistic expectations early.** Communicate the 70/30 study-to-flying ratio during initial consultations. Students who understand the commitment are students who complete their training.

**Consider branding opportunities.** Custom training materials like checklists reinforce your professional image and attention to detail.

**Approach MOSAIC strategically.** Market honestly about training duration while serving students who genuinely benefit from simplified medical requirements.

**Diversify your career messaging.** Highlight non-airline aviation careers to attract students who don't fit the traditional airline-bound profile.
