Hey there, flight school owners! We've got something special coming up, and we'd love for you to be part of it.

On **Wednesday, December 4th at 9:00 AM CST**, Right Rudder Marketing is hosting a live podcast recording with special guest Marty Tascona. This isn't your typical listen-and-learn format—this is an interactive conversation where you can jump in, ask questions, and connect with fellow aviation professionals who get what you're going through.

## Why Join Us Live?

Running a flight school means you're constantly juggling student success, instructor retention, operational efficiency, and about a hundred other things that didn't make it onto this morning's to-do list. The truth is, we all need a moment to step back, learn from others who've been there, and pick up strategies that actually work in the real world.

That's exactly what our [Aviation Business Podcast](https://open.spotify.com/show/6HqS2ljQR33xof9Xnel9Aw?si=hLNuiWmsSQqKyWrV0Iyj6g) is all about—real conversations with real people doing real things in aviation training. And when you join us live, you get something you can't get from a recording: the chance to steer the conversation toward the challenges you're facing right now.

Think about it. How often do you get to sit down with other flight school owners and industry experts without having to travel anywhere? This is your opportunity to be in the room (virtually, of course) where the discussion is happening, not just hearing about it later.

## What We'll Be Talking About

While every live episode takes on a life of its own based on who's in the conversation, here are some topics that typically come up:

**Growing Your Team**: Let's be honest—finding and keeping great flight instructors is tough right now. We'll explore what's working for schools that seem to have cracked the code on building loyal, skilled instructor teams.

**Student Success Stories**: Your students' success is your success. We'll talk about training approaches that lead to high pass rates and pilots who are truly ready for their aviation careers.

**Running a Tight Ship**: From scheduling headaches to maintenance coordination, we'll dive into operational strategies that keep things running smoothly without burning you out.

**Getting the Word Out**: Marketing your flight school effectively means more than just having a website. It's about telling your story in a way that attracts the right students—the ones who'll stick with training and become the pilots you're proud to have trained.

## Can't Make It? We've Got You Covered

Life happens, and we get it. If December 4th at 9:00 AM CST doesn't work with your schedule, don't worry. The episode will be available afterward on [Spotify](https://open.spotify.com/show/6HqS2ljQR33xof9Xnel9Aw?si=hLNuiWmsSQqKyWrV0Iyj6g), Apple Podcasts, and all the usual places you get your podcasts.

But here's the thing—there's something about being there live. The energy is different. The conversations go places they wouldn't otherwise. And you might find yourself connecting with another flight school owner who's dealing with the exact same challenge you are.

## How to Join the Conversation

It's simple. Mark your calendar for December 4th at 9:00 AM CST, and head over to our [Riverside Studio](https://riverside.fm/studio/podcast-40nqk) when it's time. Bring your questions, your experiences, and your curiosity.

This is your community. Whether you're running a small Part 61 school or managing a larger operation, you belong here. We're all working toward the same goal: training excellent pilots and running sustainable flight schools that make a real difference in people's lives.

## Why Right Rudder Marketing Gets It

At [Right Rudder Marketing](https://rightruddermarketing.com/), we're not just marketing people who happen to work with flight schools. We're [pilot-owned and aviation-focused](https://rightruddermarketing.com/about/who-we-are), which means we understand your world from the inside. We know what a good pattern looks like, what it means when a student solo's, and why that moment matters so much.

That understanding shapes everything we do, from helping you build a stronger [online presence](https://rightruddermarketing.com/) to developing marketing strategies that actually resonate with prospective students. Because at the end of the day, effective marketing starts with really understanding what makes your flight school special—and being able to communicate that clearly to the people who need to hear it.

## See You There

So, December 4th at 9:00 AM CST. [Join us live](https://riverside.fm/studio/podcast-40nqk) for what we think will be a great conversation about the things that matter most in flight training today.

Bring your coffee, bring your questions, and let's figure this stuff out together.

See you in the studio!
