Right Rudder Marketing is proud to announce its new sponsorship with King Schools, a long-standing leader in aviation education. This partnership brings together two organizations dedicated to elevating the aviation industry, each with a unique role in supporting pilot education and training.

For over 50 years, King Schools has provided pilots with innovative, engaging, and comprehensive learning solutions. With a wide range of online courses, video-based knowledge programs, and software designed to make flight training accessible and enjoyable, King Schools continues to be a cornerstone of aviation education in the U.S.

## Supporting Pilots from Start to Finish

As a sponsor, Right Rudder Marketing will work closely with King Schools to promote their mission of making learning to fly "Smart, Safe & Fun." King Schools offers a range of products that cater to both new and experienced pilots, including resources for Private Pilot License (PPL), Instrument Rating (IR), and advanced certifications.

The success of King Schools is reflected in their remarkable track record: nearly half of all U.S. pilots have trained using their materials, and 99.8% of their students pass their FAA exams. With decades of experience, King Schools continues to develop new content and resources, providing future pilots with the tools they need to succeed in their aviation careers.

## Why This Partnership Matters

The collaboration between Right Rudder Marketing and King Schools is built on a shared vision of supporting aviation education at every level. Right Rudder Marketing, as a marketing agency dedicated to the aviation sector, recognizes the significant role that quality flight training plays in shaping the industry’s future. By partnering with King Schools, we are supporting the next generation of pilots and helping to provide them with top-tier educational resources.

## Looking Ahead to 2025

This partnership marks an exciting chapter for Right Rudder Marketing. As we enter into this sponsorship, we look forward to promoting King Schools’ products, sharing their resources with the broader aviation community, and collaborating on events and initiatives that bring added value to flight schools, instructors, and students.

Right Rudder Marketing will play an active role in supporting King Schools' mission to improve flight training and pilot education, helping to make the aviation industry safer and more accessible for everyone.
