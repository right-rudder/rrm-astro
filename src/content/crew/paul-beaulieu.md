With over 14 years of experience as a Representative at FAA Safety Team and 9 years of experience as a Business Owner at AVIER Flight School, I am passionate about ensuring aviation safety and increasing the footprint of general aviation in the warmest learning environment possible. I hold multiple certifications from the FAA, including Gold Seal Certificated Flight Instructor Airplane Instrument, Multi Engine, and Multi Engine Instrument Commercial Pilot. I also have a Bachelor of Science in Music Teacher Education and a background in percussion performance and educational administration.

At AVIER Flight School, I offer basic to advanced flight training in a fleet of Piper Cherokees, a Cirrus SR22 Turbo, and a Diamond DA40. I also provide advanced avionics, currency and confidence maintenance, and aircraft rental services. My mission is to bring more people into the transformative and rewarding world of flying, while maintaining the highest standards of safety and professionalism. I have a strong track record of contributing new and return pilots to the community, and I am proud of the culture and lifestyle that we have created here in Beverly and beyond.
