She’s a full-stack developer with over three years of experience building Ruby on Rails, JavaScript, and React apps that scale. She gets energized by partnering with product and design teams to turn ideas into smooth, user-friendly experiences—and she knows her way around Docker, GraphQL, PostgreSQL, Git, TDD/CI-CD, Node, Figma, Elasticsearch, and AWS to make it happen.

A natural problem-solver and great listener, she thrives in Agile environments where curiosity and open communication drive real impact. Whether she’s optimizing a slow query or prototyping a new feature, she approaches each challenge with intention and a dash of creativity.

Off-duty, you’ll find her hitting the trails for a run, lifting weights at the gym, or exploring a nearby hiking spot. If she’s indoors, she’s probably baking up something new in the kitchen, catching a movie, or jamming out to her favorite tunes—always on the lookout for her next little adventure.
