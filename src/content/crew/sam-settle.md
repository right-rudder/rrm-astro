Sam Settle is an aviator and innovative leader, graduated in May 2025 from Oklahoma State University with a B.S. in Aerospace Administration and Operations, specializing in Professional Pilot, and a minor in Marketing. He is now pursuing a Master's in Aviation at Saint Louis University. A Certified Flight Instructor with over 330 hours of flight time, Sam's passion for aviation began on his family’s farm in Dimmitt, Texas, where early experiences in manual labor and working as ground crew for a local crop-duster shaped his resilience and fascination with flight. His pursuit of a Private Pilot’s License as a high school senior led him to Oklahoma State’s Part-141 flight training program, where he sharpened his technical skills and connected with fellow aviators, fueling his ambition to impact the industry.
