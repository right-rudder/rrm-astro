    question: "Why is social media important for flight schools?",
    answer:
      "Social media helps flight schools showcase their aircraft, highlight student successes, and build trust with prospective pilots. It's an effective way to demonstrate your school's culture, safety standards, and training quality while reaching potential students where they spend their time online.",
  },
  {
    question: "Which social media platforms work best for flight schools?",
    answer:
      "Instagram and YouTube are excellent for showcasing aircraft and flight training videos. Facebook works well for community building and local outreach. LinkedIn helps reach career-focused students interested in commercial aviation. TikTok can attract younger student pilots with engaging aviation content.",
  },
  {
    question: "How often should flight schools post on social media?",
    answer:
      "Successful flight schools typically post 3-5 times per week across platforms. Consistency is key - it's better to post regularly with quality content than to post daily with low-quality content. We recommend a mix of educational, behind-the-scenes, and student success content.",
  },
  {
    question: "What type of content performs best for aviation social media?",
    answer:
      "Flight training videos, aircraft walkarounds, student solo flights, instructor spotlights, and behind-the-scenes content perform well. Safety tips, aviation facts, and career guidance also engage audiences. Always include calls-to-action encouraging discovery flights or information requests.",
