    question: "What is flight school PPC advertising?",
    answer:
      "Flight school PPC (Pay-Per-Click) advertising involves creating targeted ads on Google, Facebook, and other platforms to reach prospective student pilots. You only pay when someone clicks on your ad, making it a cost-effective way to generate leads for your aviation academy.",
  },
  {
    question: "How much should a flight school spend on Google Ads?",
    answer:
      "Most successful flight schools invest $2,000-$8,000 per month in Google Ads, depending on their market size and competition. The key is working with an aviation marketing specialist who understands flight training keywords and can optimize your ad spend for maximum ROI.",
  },
  {
    question: "What makes flight school PPC different from other industries?",
    answer:
      "Flight school PPC requires understanding aviation-specific keywords, FAA regulations, target audience behavior, and the unique customer journey from discovery flight to enrollment. Generic PPC agencies lack the aviation expertise needed for optimal campaign performance.",
  },
  {
    question: "How quickly can PPC generate leads for my flight school?",
    answer:
      "Flight school PPC campaigns can start generating qualified leads within 24-48 hours of launch. However, optimal performance typically develops over 30-60 days as we refine targeting, keywords, and ad copy based on real performance data.",
