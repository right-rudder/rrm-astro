In an effort to grow my clients' businesses, I dived head first into marketing and sales. I attended conferences, read books, took courses to further my skills, and found mentors and coaches to guide me on the path of success. Having mentors and coaches to teach me the secrets of business was the 100LL fuel that I needed to grow my business to where it is today.
