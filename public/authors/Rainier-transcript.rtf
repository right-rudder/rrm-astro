\f1\b\fs36 \cf0 Gordon\'92s aviation journey and passion for teaching\
\pard\pardeftab720\partightenfactor0

\f0\b0\fs24 \cf0 0:55\
having me um my background is is all things airplanes um ever since I was a\
1:02\
little kid it's probably a familiar story to a lot of your listeners but you know I just love looking up and uh\
1:09\
watching the airplanes you know travel you know who knows where the the sense of freedom and um you know something\
1:16\
about it was just you know it spoke to me so when I uh decided to actually\
1:22\
pursue aviation as a a career at that time in the the early 90s\
1:28\
uh I thought well you need to go and get like an aviation degree right you have to go to a 4-year university or go to\
1:34\
the military and and get the qualifications so I ended up going to the University of North Dakota uh I got\
1:42\
a fantastic education all of my uh certificates and and ratings um upon\
1:50\
graduating I ended up moving back to the Seattle area where I grew up and started\
1:56\
teaching out of a a tiny flight school next to our our local military base little 2500 ft runway barely wide enough\
2:04\
to to keep both main tires on the pavement at the same time and uh taught for a couple of years where I then\
2:12\
realized I probably more learned more in one year of teaching than I did in four\
2:18\
years of college you know there's nothing that that uh speaks to just experience\
2:24\
getting in there making mistakes learning from it passing it along to others and that's where I really\
2:30\
developed a passion for teaching um you know being able to to assist people and\
2:36\
help them realize their goals is something that uh I really enjoyed um\
2:42\
however I still wanted to pursue that you know lifelong career flying jets in the flight levels so I ended up getting\
2:49\
um actually a job running a flight school first out in St louis in your neck of the woods so we uh we had a a\
2:58\
great operation down there it was a fantastic group of people we uh we ran a flight school out of uh Spirit Airport\
3:05\
in Chesterfield until I got my credentials up where I was competitive for a job at\
3:12\
the regionals and then was hired uh at Horizon Air in Seattle so flew D8\
3:18\
Turborops you know over the the mountains in the ice at night for another uh seven eight years got a lot\
3:26\
of really great experience uh doing that and then was hired by Alaska Airlines\
3:32\
and um am currently still a line captain at Alaska flying 737s all the way from\
3:39\
Alaska to Hawaii to Florida and everywhere in between\
3:46\
good yeah um so you're still a you know you're still in Alaska Airlines however\
3:53\
somehow in between the mix here too you started a a flight school too so you you said you were working at a flight school\
3:59\
you were in St louis then you came um I think you said Republic and then Alaska um how did many flight service I guess\
\pard\pardeftab720\sa298\partightenfactor0

\f1\b\fs36 \cf0 Starting Rainier Flight Service during the 2008 recession\
\pard\pardeftab720\partightenfactor0

\f0\b0\fs24 \cf0 4:06\
come into being well that's an interesting story um if many of you remember 2008 was a pretty\
4:13\
tough economic time um not just aviation but all kinds of businesses throughout\
4:19\
the country were really struggling financially with the economic recession\
4:24\
and airlines you know were hit particularly hard uh there were a lot of layoffs in the industry and uh I was you\
4:33\
know a fairly new pilot at the time so pretty junior on the seniority list and they said "I'm sorry but we're going to\
4:39\
have to let some people go and hopefully we'll call you back sooner than later."\
4:44\
Not knowing if that was going to be 6 months or 6 years you know you just never know so what I decided to do was\
4:52\
return to my passion um I I really didn't want to to get a job you know in\
4:57\
some other field that frankly I wasn't really qualified for i'm really good at flying airplanes um not so good at\
5:05\
marketing or finance or real estate so we uh ended up starting Rineer\
5:12\
as just a a tiny operation it was me and my partner uh Brad Donaldson uh almost\
5:19\
identical background as myself we actually met in college and our careers\
5:24\
have just chased each other ever since but we uh we leased an airplane out of Boeing Field in Seattle Washington um\
5:32\
hung out of Shingle and just started doing what we we love doing um yeah fast\
5:39\
forward you know two three years we did end up getting recalled by Alaska but in\
5:45\
that intervening time we somehow managed to create a reputation of you know\
5:50\
really providing quality instruction not just checking the boxes to make sure that you can pass the the test but\
5:57\
really preparing you to have a successful safe flying career whether it's for recreational purposes or for\
6:05\
career aspirations so we brought on more aircraft we leased\
6:11\
a few more we ended up buying a couple of aircraft other instructors started taking notice and like the way that we\
6:17\
ran the the operation so they came on board as uh instructors and the business\
6:23\
really took on a life of its own today um you know it's been almost 15 years\
6:29\
but we've been extremely fortunate finding just fantastic people really is\
6:36\
is the core of our business and uh currently have\
6:42\
over 70 aircraft uh probably 130 plus employees and um you know just loving\
6:49\
every day it's amazing i mean it's it's very easy just to like kind of look back\
6:55\
and look at kind of the accomplishment that you kind of did i think part of it is just staying in the game but\
7:00\
obviously it's not linear you know there's some um ups and downs and you\
7:05\
know I think you know I think even starting out you know leasing a plane and also getting you know like like you\
7:11\
said getting a shingle um you know you had to put some type of upfront capital right so there's you know it's not\
7:16\
always net positive um can you share kind of some of the challenges that you know you kind of\
7:22\
faced when you you know I guess there's different stages of running a business right so you kind of have your startup st phase you have your scaling phase and\
7:29\
kind of after that um probably that's around maybe I want to say 10 to 20 planes and you're kind of more\
7:35\
established then you have like the significance phase where you start really making a huge impact um but you\
7:40\
know a lot of schools and a lot of businesses never get it out of the startup phase um and that's really one\
7:46\
of the challenges we have in the industry Um and not just our industry but just as a whole um as business owners entrepreneurs um people that are\
7:53\
trying to start businesses um how do we how do a small what's some\
7:59\
advice you can give to a smaller school and what are some of the challenges you did or you had and then um how did you\
\pard\pardeftab720\sa298\partightenfactor0

\f1\b\fs36 \cf0 Challenges of scaling a flight school and how to overcome them\
\pard\pardeftab720\partightenfactor0

\f0\b0\fs24 \cf0 8:04\
overcome those challenges and like how can other small schools kind of learn from your mistakes you know that's\
8:10\
absolutely right fundamentally you know even though we're doing something that we're all passionate about you know\
8:16\
being paid to fly airplanes is you know the greatest job ever right but as a business owner there's a lot of other\
8:22\
considerations that you have to factor in you know it's the the regulatory\
8:28\
requirements making sure that you know not just yourself but all of your employees are are compliant um you know\
8:36\
having a business strategy uh one of the first things that we did and I credit with a lot of our uh initial success was\
8:45\
actually developing a business plan uh we reached out to the local small business administration and had a mentor\
8:53\
kind of help me through that initial process and it was painful believe me\
8:58\
this is not like something that you can spend a couple of hours in the afternoon and knock out it really takes a lot of\
9:05\
you know thoughtful introspection uh doing a market research and analysis to\
9:10\
figure out you know what are your strengths and weaknesses and how can you develop marketing strategies the\
9:16\
financial aspects um but you know what nothing is is free\
9:23\
in life uh a well-crafted business plan going through the process is really what\
9:30\
you need to define your place in the market and set up your business for\
9:36\
success um you know I've heard this before like the business plan and and kind of\
9:42\
running you know doing that what in your opinion is what what should be included\
9:48\
in a business plan i think you know just kind of my story is like you know I used to make a you know right marketing is\
9:55\
not my first business you know I had a few failures on the way um before we had right marketing and um every time I'd\
10:01\
make this like you know 50-page document for business plans and like here's the market projection here's the finances\
10:07\
here's here's my startup capital whatever it is you know here's here's here's the product here's the manufacturing instructions for my\
10:12\
product or whatever it is and um those always failed and then surprisingly right with the marketing I kind of had\
10:18\
an idea of what I wanted to do and I didn't have a plan i don't I have a plan but I never wrote it down but I just I\
10:24\
just started and then here we are so I mean there's different ways to kind of skin the cat so to speak and I think\
10:32\
it's you know maybe it's imperative we understand what are the fundamental core you know I guess aspects of a business\
10:39\
plan that we need to have in mind um whether they're written or not um what's your take on that you know and it\
10:46\
doesn't have to be really formal this isn't like an MBA project that you're going to turn in as a thesis you\
10:52\
certainly could if you want to go down that academic path but really you can\
10:57\
take the the core elements of a business plan and simply going through that as a\
11:03\
thought exercise is going to pay dividends if you split it into multiple categories you're probably going to\
11:09\
determine you know what's really important the uh the financial structure\
11:15\
um if you're just starting out aviation is very capital intensive right you know aircraft whether you're leasing or\
11:22\
buying are not cheap so how are you going to determine your pricing strategy\
11:27\
what will the market bear on a competitive um uh you know balance um if you have a\
11:38\
leased airplane and you're looking to purchase how can you forecast what type of revenue I need what is my profit\
11:45\
margin um going through that exercise and actually running the numbers will\
11:50\
give you a lot of tools to be able to adequately prepare and then you know\
11:55\
scale as appropriate if you're kind of winging it yeah you'll probably get by\
12:02\
but are there missed opportunities along the way um you know do you have set\
12:07\
goals and a plan to get there that's really what the business plan is going to help you dial in in addition I would\
12:16\
say you know the marketing determining what your niche is are are you going to\
12:21\
be just you know your average typical flight school that does zero to hero are\
12:27\
you going to you know set yourself apart by maybe providing you know specialized\
12:32\
tail wheel instruction or mountain flying instruction you know there's so many uh niche areas that you can take\
12:41\
advantage of but ultimately you need to define who you are and what sets you\
12:47\
apart from your competitors why should people patronize you versus some other school you know down the road\
12:56\
yeah that's you know in marketing t or marketing terms I believe that's called\
13:01\
the unique value proposition you know UVP and something that we try to teach our flight schools that we work with um\
13:08\
is how do we define what your brand is and what's your target market what's your target avatar right um so I guess\
13:14\
that kind of brings the next question up like what is your flight services UVP and who's who's your target market what\
\pard\pardeftab720\sa298\partightenfactor0

\f1\b\fs36 \cf0 Defining your flight school\'92s unique value proposition (UVP)\
\pard\pardeftab720\partightenfactor0

\f0\b0\fs24 \cf0 13:20\
are you trying to market towards yeah I you I call our our unfair advantage is\
13:28\
um our background and experience you know there's a lot of really good instructors out there few have the\
13:35\
opportunity to actually go through you know flying for the airlines being a part of training departments you know\
13:42\
seeing flying at that at that level and then taking the best elements of you\
13:48\
know highly structured standardized professional flying and bringing it back to GA so for example you know we all\
13:57\
learn about ADM right in the airplane flying handbook it talks a lot about you\
14:03\
know decision-making processes and you know the five Ps and I'm safe all that\
14:09\
good stuff well at the airlines we actually employ the same thing but it's\
14:14\
boiled down into a very simple process so before every flight we take a few\
14:20\
moments and we uh perform what we call a threat and error management briefing where we as a crew or as an instructor\
14:29\
and a client discuss okay what's going to get us in trouble today what are our\
14:34\
threats is it aircraft status you know maybe there's an unresolved discrepancy\
14:41\
uh is it weather is it traffic because it's a beautiful Saturday afternoon and there's going to be people that don't\
14:47\
believe in radios using the traffic pattern with us you know there's all kinds of potential threats out there so\
14:53\
why don't we actually identify them and come up with mitigation strategies what are we going to do to minimize those\
15:01\
threats as much as possible and having that conversation just on uh a routine\
15:08\
basis almost wires our brains to be thinking along those lines after 5 10\
15:16\
lessons the students are going to be going through this in their mind driving to the airport so that is what we're\
15:22\
trying to instill that is just second nature for us at the airlines\
15:28\
in addition uh most airlines employ more of a um you know we call it AQP where\
15:34\
it's a a train to proficiency model we took the elements of that and applied it\
15:39\
to general aviation and kind of wo in that scenario-based training so no one\
15:45\
really wants to go out and do steep turns and slow flight and touch and goes and call it a day i mean sure you can\
15:53\
learn to fly an airplane doing that but I think there's a lot more to be gained\
15:59\
by actually placing students in specific situations with you know little Easter\
16:05\
eggs um let's throw some curve balls and see if you identify them and how you\
16:11\
handle those challenges so that they learn and develop experience that's why\
16:17\
we're here as instructors is to provide a safe environment for students to experience as much variety as possible\
16:25\
so that by the time that they're on their own with that certificate in their wallet you know that they are going to\
16:32\
make good decisions and they'll be safe and have a long enjoyable flying career\
16:38\
what are some of the um fun scenarios that you guys put students through like I think I had one that was um like you\
16:44\
know you're doing cross country and your grandma's with you or something like that and you know your your airport's an\
16:50\
hour away but she really has to use the restroom what do you do you know so that was a very easy one but other ones can be a lot more difficult like you know\
16:56\
weather issues you know what's a ceiling on let's say you have 1000 foot ceiling and you're trying to do an IFR plan um\
17:02\
what's some fun ones that maybe some instructors that um are listening that could can use you know put in their\
17:07\
toolbox yeah I I like to take you know some very real world examples and you\
17:13\
can do this no matter where you are in the country or the world you know up in our area we are blessed being close to\
17:20\
the mountains by the ocean a lot of dynamic weather and conditions so to\
17:25\
your point for like cross-country planning for example um why don't we use this as an\
17:31\
opportunity to do a weight and balance exercise say a buddy is up in the San Juan Islands and he just had the mother\
17:38\
load of uh crab traps this weekend so you've got to go up to the San Juans uh\
17:46\
load up your airplane with as much fresh crab as you can pack in the coolers and\
17:52\
then take it over to another airport drop it off and then fly back how are you going to work the\
17:58\
weight and balance to to figure that out you know so that's one element of it oh\
18:03\
and then by the way by the time you pick up the crab maybe it takes a little bit longer to to load up into the airplane\
18:10\
the weather is starting to get a little bit worse you know you see it trending down it's deteriorating oh and it's\
18:17\
starting to get dark too that second airport you're going to drop everything off of is kind of close to the mountains\
18:24\
getting into the foothills so you've got you know terrain issues what are you thinking about how are you going to\
18:30\
manage that you know is is it legal is it safe what can you do to to minimize\
18:36\
the threats yeah legal and safe are two different things i mean there's a lot of things\
18:42\
that are legal i mean technically you could take off with a zero visibility i mean and there not and part 91\
18:48\
operations at least um you know so yeah we have to employ a little bit\
18:55\
of ADM as pilots to make sure that we're doing everything you know proficiently and safely right um let's roll it back\
19:02\
to growing the business so I know we were getting into like kind of the nitty-gritty of instructing and um you\
19:07\
know the and um but a lot of people here are are business owners and we we you know CFIs already and they kind of know\
19:13\
um the CFI game so you one of the things that you mentioned when you were talking about starting rain your flight service\
19:19\
was um having a great team and I think that's so important for any business no\
19:25\
matter where you are in in your business cycle or business phase whether you're in startup whether you're in scaling\
19:31\
whether you're in significance phase whether you're in like the growth phase um how did you I guess\
19:38\
find an elite team of um individuals to join many flight service to take it from\
19:45\
you know a few couple leased aircraft to multiple locations 70 planes um obviously I know there's just a time\
19:51\
factor in there as well you know as long as you're in the game when you just keep doing it year after year and you just keep growing and hitting the right\
19:57\
targets um it's one thing but I think having the right people accelerates your\
20:02\
growth right um so what what's kind of your tips for interviewing and finding the right people and you know recruiting\
20:09\
you know there's a few different aspects of that one is you know finding the right people is is really key uh when\
20:16\
you're developing your business you as the leader of the organization are responsible for creating the culture and\
20:24\
it's ultimately going to be you know uh what you decide is the way that your\
20:31\
employees um you know deliver a customer experience whether it's good or bad\
20:37\
fortunately in aviation most people are pretty passionate about what we do so\
20:43\
it's not hard to find people that are really excited and want to share that\
20:48\
excitement with future generations of aviators so as we've grown we've\
20:53\
actually employed a lot of people that were previous clients you know maybe they came to us they got their private\
20:59\
but their background was in finance um our director of finance today uh is a\
21:07\
CPA he had a career a very successful one working for you know accounting\
21:12\
organizations but he loved airplanes and what better solution than to mirror\
21:19\
those two up you know use and leverage your experience and background with a\
21:24\
very critical skill set in managing the business but do it in an environment where you're surrounded by you know\
21:31\
airplanes if it's a beautiful day and you know all the bills are paid and the work is done and it's\
21:38\
2:00 you know grab an available airplane and go out and enjoy the benefits that's\
21:44\
something that no accounting firm is going to be able to offer as uh a employee benefit\
21:50\
um so we've taken a lot of people that um you know began as clients from us and\
21:57\
then just wanted to stay involved in in some capacity hopefully leveraging their\
22:02\
prior experience and and skill sets kind of mentioned over there brand and\
22:08\
culture so you hire these good people you know they're the previous students um you help them get their private maybe\
22:13\
you got them to instrument CFI depending on where they want to take their career at um but they they really loved your\
22:20\
business they really loved the instruction you gave um the product and service that you offered them and so\
22:26\
much so that um it was enough to kind of say hey you know you're able to you know work here um and make a living here\
22:34\
there is some type of culture brand that's associated i mean not not not all flight schools are equal right i think\
22:40\
um I've walked into a few flight schools where I was like I would never work here but um I mean that's I'll still fly your\
22:46\
plane at least once but you know there's other schools where I I go there repetitively you know like there's like\
22:51\
you know there's some places where I rent planes repetitively you know whether it's price whether it's the people that how they greet me whether\
22:57\
it's how they how they maintain their aircraft um what's some of the what's the brand and culture at Rainer Flight\
23:03\
Service and um how did you establish that how did you come up with it i I often fall back on our core values\
23:10\
um when we were in our early days you know drafting that business plan one of the exercises is you know really\
23:17\
thinking about what defines you what is really important to you and your\
23:22\
organization and I know it's kind of gotten to be a little you know cliche\
23:28\
you know people put core values on their website and you know it's it's almost like this virtue signaling but really\
23:35\
when it's done right is what you're trying to incorporate into the the\
23:41\
culture of your operation and one of those is integrity for us\
23:46\
i know we've all heard horror stories about you know flight schools that have taken advantage of students you know\
23:52\
maybe taken large sums of money up front and then ended up closing their doors and students are left out in the cold\
23:59\
you know it really it it taints aviation in a very bad light when that happens\
24:06\
and I wanted to be very careful and make sure that when we're developing policies\
24:13\
procedures you know handling challenging situations that we always fall back on\
24:20\
what is the right thing to do you know maybe it's not the cheapest solution\
24:25\
maybe it's going to cost us some money um but what is best for the client um\
24:32\
and I I found that if you really stick to your integrity\
24:38\
um it will pay dividends in your reputation and the culture and the way\
24:43\
that your employees represent your organization and think and and go about their daily\
24:50\
tasks so again back to the business plan really thinking about what type of\
24:56\
business do I want to run what type of reputation do I want to create and uh\
25:02\
stick to it yeah I I you know I I think the core\
25:08\
value thing is very there's two ways it can go it can either be overused and\
25:13\
just kind of thrown away as there's no value to it just like "Hey yeah we have core values like strength you know like I was working for Tyson Foods you know\
25:19\
for example um before I was piloting on stuff and they would call they would call it the five C's you know like\
25:25\
cander caring but everyone everyone in management didn't like they didn't care you know we're just there for a job."\
25:32\
So it's like you know did the core values actually hold it was not until someone from corporate came down and\
25:38\
started like you know breathing it down our throats that we said "Okay yeah we care we'll be candid you know um we'll\
25:43\
use the privacies but you know if you actually went to the plant level it just wasn't actually like lived and I think\
25:48\
they're trying to change that i think they're trying to you know I think they're they are working better um to you know maybe they change the core values since I've been there um but then\
25:55\
on the other hand you have you know core values where it it it does mean something you know and it does actually\
26:01\
impact the business that's how we run and I think you know if you do it right it should help and you know I learned\
26:08\
this from some some of my mentors as well is that these core values should align with your mission and vision of\
26:15\
the company um because that way you know because you can't really as a business\
26:20\
owner you can't be everywhere every time at every place you know you have you have to be able to\
26:26\
delegate um the work to your team members um and you have to trust your team members right so if they're not\
26:33\
really rowing this rowing in the same way and they're just kind of you know I'm gonna do it my way and you know I\
26:39\
could care less and all that stuff um and they're not really following the core values that you've established they're not really marching towards\
26:44\
mission vision you're gonna you um your business is not going to start scaling and growing um kind of on that\
26:51\
same note here so you mentioned core values um and there's a whole culture thing with that um and it really leads\
26:57\
into mission and vision so I kind of want to segue this conversation into the mission and vision of not so much\
27:04\
Rainineer as well but also just Gordon you know what what is your mission and vision um so what do what do you try to\
27:10\
do because obviously you've scaled um Reineer to quite a big level here um where do you see I guess your\
27:17\
enterprises um kind of lead into the next couple years five years 10 years 30 years um what type of impact are you\
27:24\
trying to drive to your um your customers and your students um yeah where are you trying to take it yeah boy\
27:31\
uh I wish I had a very clear answer because honestly um I'm just enjoying the ride um we've we've been very\
27:40\
fortunate um you know the the flight school has been extremely successful and\
27:45\
again I give credit to you know the the team making it happen we provide the\
27:50\
mission and the vision which is to provide you know safe affordable effective flight training in a fun\
27:57\
environment because let's be honest if you're not looking forward to going to the airport\
28:03\
and flying around on a beautiful day we're doing something incredibly wrong so it's got to be safe and good use of\
28:12\
the client's time and money um and you know produce safe future pilots i think\
28:20\
in the future um I'll backtrack a little bit as we scaled the operation um especially when\
28:28\
you you get from that like three to five airplane up to 15 20 aircraft it takes\
28:35\
more than just people to be able to scale effectively um you need to put in\
28:40\
like workflows and and tools and policies so that you can you know\
28:46\
maintain standardization and efficiencies there's simply no way to do that without leveraging technology and\
28:54\
we looked at all of the different solutions on the market we try to find\
28:59\
you know what is going to accommodate our scheduling needs our finances\
29:05\
um you know safety management all of the different elements of of running a\
29:10\
flight school and there really wasn't anything available or at least nothing that touched all the points that we were\
29:17\
looking to integrate so fortunately being in the Seattle area\
29:23\
we do have one or two tech people around uh some may have been clients um and we\
29:30\
actually developed our internal uh system for integrating all of these\
\pard\pardeftab720\sa298\partightenfactor0

\f1\b\fs36 \cf0 How Needle 9 was born to solve flight school pain points\
\pard\pardeftab720\partightenfactor0

\f0\b0\fs24 \cf0 29:36\
different aspects of running the operation and that's where Nele 9 was was born we uh spent a couple years in\
29:44\
development being really thoughtful on what would be an ideal solution we have\
29:50\
an opportunity to create something from from scratch uh what would that look like so we broke down workflows on you\
29:59\
know uh lead generation and the sales funnel and ensuring a positive onboarding experience uh for new clients\
30:07\
getting started you know it's it's very confusing if you don't know what you're doing there's so much information being\
30:14\
thrown at you we wanted to boil it down and make it just as easy and simple as\
30:19\
possible and the software helps us uh accomplish that then as they complete\
30:25\
their training making sure that they know exactly what to expect every single flight lesson how can I prepare and use\
30:33\
that time with my instructor as efficiently as possible what are my strengths and weaknesses all of the\
30:39\
integrated lesson records are right there and completely transparent so people know exactly where they're at all\
30:46\
the way to you know paying my invoices and managing my account balances safety\
30:52\
management so after a few years of you know collecting feedback from our\
30:58\
clients and iterating stabilizing the system we thought you know what there's\
31:04\
probably a lot of other flight schools out there that could use a tool like this too and we can't be the only ones\
31:10\
that are struggling so we decided to open it up and license it to other\
31:16\
schools around the country and that's really been our focus is you know not just providing a software tool because I\
31:23\
know there's many out there but how can we help them use it effectively um I'm\
31:30\
not just looking for you know subscribers to a software system as I am\
31:35\
developing a robust healthy industry\
31:42\
that's a mouthful yeah so um we kind of went from mission vision to Neo9 so I'm\
31:49\
glad you brought this up um you mentioned there's a struggle there's a struggle point so around three to five\
31:55\
aircraft you know you're able to kind of do it on your own kind of use your own systems and stuff once you get above 10\
32:02\
approximately um there starts to be some system breakdowns i think that's what you mentioned here like 10 to 15 perhaps\
32:09\
um and yeah there's different solutions out there different software companies some of them have already been on the podcast\
32:16\
um let's let's let's take let's go let's take it one by one so what are some of the I guess challenges or obstructions\
32:24\
or maybe um system breakdowns that you encountered when you did start to scale from say like 5 to 10 aircraft to like\
32:30\
10 to 15 aircraft what are some of the specific um I guess examples of like hey\
32:35\
I can't use this I can't use my Excel sheet anymore what what are some of those um I guess problems that you might\
32:41\
have had yeah I would say a big one is the financial management um you know you\
32:47\
could hire just more and more employees to take care of the just the basic\
32:52\
clerical accounting stuff or you could let the software do it all for you and I\
32:58\
wanted to you know keep the headcount to a minimum keep our overhead costs as low\
33:04\
as we can i'm a firm believer in operating a lean organization and you know pass those\
33:11\
savings along to the client at the flight school our model has never been to be like the most expensive or the the\
33:19\
cheapest on the market there's many great flight schools out there what we\
33:24\
strive to be is like the Costco we want to provide you know the best value for\
33:31\
your money so that kind of puts us in that sweet spot and if we can keep our\
33:36\
our overhead you know within that window we can also keep our rates at an\
33:41\
affordable level where kids coming out of high school can actually become a pilot while working a summer job you\
33:48\
know that's that's tough to do these days it's gotten really expensive\
33:53\
so the the financial management is a big time savings all of the the invoices are\
34:00\
generated automatically through the system it seamlessly syncs with QuickBooks customers can manage their\
34:07\
their payment methods that will automatically process and then post the\
34:12\
receipts to their account so there is zero manual intervention maybe once a\
34:18\
week or once a month we'll kind of audit the records and just make sure that you know everything is is looking good but\
34:26\
our employees are spending their time focusing on higher level finance stuff\
34:31\
like are our aircraft profitable we can run reports on if we look at the fleet\
34:38\
which aircraft are performing well and which are spending more time in the hanger than we anticipated so we can\
34:46\
gain insights and make informed decisions to continue to improve the business\
34:52\
that's you know one big example as you start to to scale the operation it's\
34:57\
easy to get so caught up in the day-to-day stuff you lose the big picture\
35:04\
yeah the financial management aspect of any business is very important so there's a few I guess we can kind of\
35:10\
what you call um go step by step with the different processes in financial management because I think it's I I think it's\
35:16\
important i think as running a business I mean one of the things that we try to tell you know when we're prospecting for future flight schools too is like you\
35:23\
know if you have no revenue and if you have no profit then you're not really operating a successful business and one of the things we help at Ritter\
35:29\
Marketing at least is to generate your topline revenue that way hopefully over time your bottom line um does increase\
35:35\
so one of the things you mentioned is you know running a lean organization um and keeping you know your headcount low\
35:42\
um lean by the way and I think a lot of people misconstrue what the meaning of\
35:48\
lean was because it it did derive from manufacturing and that's kind of my background was lean manufacturing um a\
35:54\
lot of it was actually from to Toyota toyota was actually a um was the forerunner to um the continuous\
36:01\
improvement methodology with um a thing called Kaizen um what that means is continuously improving every single day\
36:07\
you know we have like daily huddles for example we have notes that we do we have follow-ups every week um we also have\
36:13\
what's called just in time production so you know when as we scale the business do we have the right amount of people um\
36:19\
doesn't running a lean organization doesn't just mean like chopping heads off you know i think that's I think it's\
36:24\
what people think about you know they first hear that term like oh they're just going to fire everybody that's not right\
36:30\
um I've I've you know in my experience in business and also you know running you know running manufacturing factories\
36:37\
and all that stuff and and also running my own business you know the question of\
36:42\
overhead and headcount is a very big one so you know I I have a number in my head\
36:48\
as far as what the pro what the appropriate percentage of um budget I should be spending towards people is um\
36:54\
I'd like to kind of hear your take on it before I give my number away so what what what's your approximate um let's\
37:00\
say we're not let's say let's make the numbers even so let's say we're you know let's say $100 let's say our revenue is\
37:05\
$100 how many of those $100 should be spent towards you know paying people and\
37:11\
hiring people and so on boy uh I'd have to compare like the KPIs\
37:17\
and the financials i'd say in general we actually pay our employees very well um\
37:25\
you know I'm sure there's a wide variety in uh in flight schools and the benefits they offer but we can actually you know\
37:32\
pay top market rates to our staff uh while setting high expectations you know\
37:39\
we tell our instructors look we know that you're going to be moving on to the airlines in in a year and a half two\
37:46\
years that's totally fine i was there myself i I get it what we do expect\
37:52\
though is while you're here you deliver the best quality training that you can\
37:57\
and we're going to treat you as professionals and pay you as professionals so we offer health\
38:04\
benefits 401k um PTO you know all that kind of stuff\
38:11\
but we also expect high performance in return so when I say lean I mean more\
38:18\
efficient um Let's use the resources available to the maximum extent and not\
38:25\
just throw money at solving problems that's where my partner and I I think have have worked so well together\
38:33\
because we're always balancing ideas off each other and trying to figure out you know how do we solve this problem and\
38:39\
usually between the two of us we come up with a halfway decent answer and it's usually like let's get creative let's\
38:47\
stay hungry and lean and figure out the the root cause and address that versus\
38:53\
just cutting a check and making it go away that's what I mean by you know lean\
38:59\
um mentality running an operation yeah I like that so yeah we we spend X\
39:07\
amount per per employee as well one of the things you you mentioned here is you know the benefits and stuff like that so\
39:12\
you know as a member and a sponsor of what's called um flight school association North America FANA you know they do give a lot of consulting and\
39:19\
advice towards flight schools and um one of the kind of biggest themes I've heard and I don't know if you could hear this\
39:25\
is you know W2 versus 1099 so for CFIs obviously the it's a revolving door you\
39:30\
know they're they're in they're out they're trying to get their their flight hours in 15 you know magic 1500 um and\
39:35\
they go to the airlines what's your advice for I guess hiring them do you go W2 do you go 1099 and if so\
39:43\
um how do you manage that at Rainer flight service and also you know if you use do you use Nele 9 also for kind of\
39:49\
HR records and all stuff too or what's the extent of how does needle 9 kind of play a part into this yeah well the\
39:56\
needle 9 part again it just helps us realize efficiencies because it tracks\
40:01\
all of the hours build by instructor by type you know I can run reports to know\
40:07\
exactly you know what percentage of our revenue is coming from flight instruction versus ground instruction\
40:13\
versus you know stage check evaluations you know all of that rich data I can\
40:19\
manipulate in any way I want to to gain insights but the I I think your overall\
40:26\
question around the contractor versus employee really kind of depends on the\
40:32\
state here in the state of Washington it's pretty black and white if if you're\
40:39\
telling an instructor hey I need you to be here you know for these hours per day\
40:44\
and you're going to deliver the the instruction per my syllabus\
40:50\
it's pretty hard to argue that they're really an independent contractor um they're they're really representing your\
40:56\
business and organization and uh doing it in a way that you expect uh\
41:03\
representing your company whereas an independent contractor is much more of\
41:08\
like a flying club um if it's just you know I'm a club member like everyone\
41:15\
else that happens to have a CFI certificate and you know I set my own\
41:20\
hours I can do whatever I want then yeah clearly you're just an independent\
41:25\
contractor doing your own thing but I I encourage businesses i I understand the\
41:32\
temptation to save a buck in taxes and you know try to to you know stay under\
41:40\
the radar but you got to be careful because if there was an audit and the state determined that yeah all of these\
41:47\
employees that you've been paying as contractors really are employees and by\
41:52\
the way we calculated the back taxes that are owed you do not want to be in that\
41:58\
position no that's a horrible place to go you know talk talk with a CPA or an\
42:04\
accounting professional in your specific jurisdiction and at least know exactly\
42:09\
where you stand so you know you know what your potential exposure is love\
42:14\
that um let's get into like kind of the software because we have we're about 15\
42:19\
minutes left in the show and um I want to kind of you kind of mentioned some of the cool features there so you were able\
42:25\
to kind of look at the billable hours as far as where it goes um you're able to do invoicing scheduling um what are some\
42:32\
of the things we might have missed as far as features that have we haven't talked about yet um so far well I mean\
42:40\
the non sexy stuff that's critically important like you know documentation\
42:46\
i think I think documentation is very sexy man i don't know what you're talking about it's It's so important i\
42:52\
mean you got to make sure that you're compliant with all the FAA records if you're 141 there's all kinds of you know\
42:59\
currency requirements for your aircraft for your instructors and you know properly organized software will just\
43:05\
take all of that off your plate and tell you "Oh hey by the way Tim is due for\
43:12\
his 141 annual currency by the end of the month do you want to get that\
43:17\
scheduled?" Yes I do you know I don't have to track it and think about it uh all the time tsa\
43:26\
obviously you know everyone is is worried about oh the the uh TSA is going\
43:32\
to come in and do their annual audit of our records so we better spend a couple of weeks you know getting everything in\
43:37\
order for us it's come by anytime you want all I've got to do is pull up the\
43:43\
records it'll take five minutes and it's really zero stress it's it's simple but\
43:50\
you have to have the the processes in place to do that the software just makes it really simple one thing that I'm\
43:58\
actually pretty excited about and I I feel you know personally passionate about is safety management um maybe it's\
44:06\
my airline background but you know having that philosophy or\
44:12\
making it part of your company culture that we value safety that we're always looking for continuous improvement and\
44:20\
kind of that threat error management model that I was talking about you know for pre-flight preparation can apply for\
44:27\
your business as a whole if you look at your operation and think okay what are\
44:34\
our threats as a a flight school what is going to get our students hurt are our\
44:41\
instructors hurt or in trouble or violated and what can we proactively do\
44:47\
to mitigate that as much as possible uh we actually provide a lot of our uh\
44:52\
flight school subscribers you know a template for a safety management systems\
44:57\
manual and say here take this document edit it up you know make whatever\
45:03\
changes are appropriate for your operation and try to get your staff on board to if they witness something if\
45:11\
they experience something whether it's a class B bust or someone you know fell off the ladder checking the fuel on the\
45:18\
wing um you know report it so that now we've got this data source that we can\
45:25\
track over time and see trends and figure out do we need to improve our\
45:31\
curriculum to address a weak area do we need to provide resources to our you\
45:36\
know ground operations um if you don't know you can't really do\
45:42\
anything about it right so the safety management is a big cornerstone of of\
45:49\
our system that I think or I hope has a a good positive impact on the operators\
45:57\
y I think um I know it's required for I believe believe part 121 operations and\
46:02\
you know SMS right but I believe if I've heard this right in the industry it's starting to roll out down to the abio\
46:08\
level to the part 61 or part 6141 level too um so a lot of people that are just\
46:17\
starting out you know maybe building in their own flight school maybe they're they were in your shoes like where you were a couple you know decades ago when\
46:22\
you were at one less plane um and they're hearing hey we got to implement a SMS system a safety management system\
46:29\
um what would be I guess the kind of the requirements to run that and how would\
46:34\
needle 9 help you um to establish you know an SMS system at your flight school\
46:40\
really all you need is the will to take it seriously um you know that's when I\
46:46\
was saying I'm not really interested in just you know having people subscribe to the system as I am making sure that you\
46:53\
know how to use the tools properly to improve your profitability and and\
46:59\
safety and efficiency so you know using safety as an example\
47:07\
we'll provide you a template a handbook that you can modify and incorporate into your uh organization um happy to get on\
47:14\
a call with you and say you know here's the kind of the philosophical things that you want to instill or here are\
47:21\
some practical tasks that you can do to implement this tool the system itself\
47:28\
allows any person to either anonymously or they can self-report any kind of\
47:34\
safety um thing that they experience and that goes to a specific\
47:41\
individual identified in the system who's responsible for safety management and they respond um either by taking a\
47:50\
specific action or just saying "Ah that was a a one-off event nothing exactly\
47:56\
needs to be done about it but maybe we want to track it for for trend\
48:01\
information and you know based on the results of that then you can start looking at do I need to make this a\
48:09\
point of discussion at the next instructor meeting and beef up standardization do I need to modify our\
48:15\
checklist procedures so that you know this step isn't being consistently missed that we're seeing over and over\
48:21\
or whatever that remediation strategy is yeah yeah you know a lot of the things\
48:28\
that they're implementing here in the airlines applies to manufacturing so I know manufacturing is not related to\
48:34\
aviation but you know we had anonymous reporting we had safety committees we had a committee chair typically known as\
48:41\
safety officer um then they had regularly frequently scheduled audits you know they'd go around um walk the\
48:46\
ramp you know check check things make sure it's all right um and they do interview you know that's so I think\
48:52\
those are some of the core features of implementing SMS obviously you'd have to read the documents you know and get that\
48:57\
i think that you provide a really great service um by providing kind of a template and kind of you know leading\
49:03\
them on the way to get to get um compliant so um we are in the last kind of 10 minutes in this show here and um\
49:11\
you know I wanted to kind of give you the opportunity to kind of you know do some final call to actions and some\
49:17\
pitches out there so we we talked about how you grow how you grew Rainer Flight Service um and in your process of\
49:24\
growing it from you know one plane to over 70 planes four locations you met a lot of struggles and I think that kind\
49:29\
of hit around you know that 10 airplane mark roughly um at you notice like hey\
49:36\
there's you know invoicing issues there's financial issues you know how do we get people going um there's you know\
49:41\
h having the right team in place and making sure that the core values are instilled correctly um and that you know\
49:47\
we're we're actually offering our you know UVP or unique value prop to our customers correctly right um there's\
49:53\
also safety concerns too making sure that we're implementing a um a proper safety management system there's scheduling concerns and um a lot of that\
50:00\
that you a lot of these challenges that you've encountered along the way um use those challenges to build Nele 9 right\
50:08\
um so walk us through like you know if someone is starting out and let's say they're at that level let's say they're\
50:13\
around a million dollars in revenue that usually is around seven planes if I calculate this right seven eight planes\
50:18\
they may be they might be around a million dollars in revenue maybe $1.5 million in annual revenue but they're trying to grow to let's say three\
50:25\
million or let's say five million maybe their vision their vision hopefully they establish their mission and vision um is\
50:30\
to be a bigger school to open up another location um what's your kind of offer\
\pard\pardeftab720\sa298\partightenfactor0

\f1\b\fs36 \cf0 Advice for flight school owners aiming to scale to multi-million-dollar revenue\
\pard\pardeftab720\partightenfactor0

\f0\b0\fs24 \cf0 50:35\
what's your pitch to kind of help these people to achieve their goals my if I were to give like advice or\
50:43\
recommendations it's to you know stack your bench um you know I'm certainly not\
50:50\
smart enough to do all of this on my own you know I'm a pilot i fly airplanes i\
50:55\
don't know anything about finance or market strategies or you know any of\
51:00\
that i understand that it's important and I want to do it properly um so you\
51:08\
know as we've grown you know you you face different challenges at different points in your scaling you know when you\
51:15\
hit 10 airplanes it's more about okay consolidating workflows and trying to maintain efficiencies because having a\
51:24\
paper ledger isn't going to work anymore once you get to 20 30 airplanes the\
51:30\
challenge is going to be standardization how can I ensure that you know my staff my instructors are delivering the the\
51:38\
quality that I expect and I don't have the time to you know mentor and and\
51:45\
monitor that 24 hours a day so I'm going to have to delegate some of that stuff\
51:51\
to other people and that's where you start to you know grow your organization and put those workflows in place for\
51:59\
measuring instructor performance how do you proactively you know look at training records to identify client\
52:06\
issues before they have to come to you you know with complaints you you'd much\
52:12\
rather nip it in the bud before it gets out of control so if you can find the people such as\
52:20\
yourself you know chances are you're not going to be an expert in marketing but you know that it's a critical part of\
52:29\
you know growing your business so find someone like Tim and\
52:35\
explain you know this is where I'm at this is where I want to be as an expert\
52:40\
you know what can you help me uh accomplish so that you know we can uh\
52:47\
meet our goals and our targets um finances you know find that CPA or\
52:54\
accountant that can be an external set of eyes and making sure that your books are in order so that when you need to go\
53:00\
to the bank and get that loan to buy a new airplane it's not this stressful\
53:06\
drawn out process you're well organized you got everything in order um you know\
53:12\
an attorney you know make just like you have a personal doctor that you go to you've got a relationship but they\
53:18\
understand your your background and your history you want that attorney to be your advocate so that when something\
53:24\
comes up you can just go to them and know that it'll be handled you know\
53:29\
properly according to your core values with integrity and so forth but um that\
53:37\
would be my advice is you know find your all-star team and the the earlier you\
53:43\
can do it the faster it's going to propel you to\
53:49\
scale i think that's completely correct you know I think even in right order marketing we\
53:54\
have you know I've gone through a few CPAs to be honest with you they'll\
53:59\
they'll I mean I don't know this it's a mixed bag it's kind of like hiring too like you know we've gone through a few employees as well here at Redwood\
54:05\
Marketing and some of them um you know maybe it didn't work out but other people that you know remained on the team um and I we wouldn't be where we're\
54:12\
at without them to be honest with you like they're they're you know I like to say that we have a team of rock stars and um and and I think it's so important\
54:19\
is finding your all-star team make sure they're all air players i think you mentioned CPA was good so accounting\
54:24\
legal um finance you got also instructors the people actually doing you know the technician where going out\
54:30\
there and um flying the planes teach delivering your service and product right um I like how you kind of like um\
54:38\
you're really giving the the bigger picture stuff you're not really what do you call it you're not I I like how\
54:45\
you're like when I talk to you you're really trying to help you know you're not trying to say here here's my\
54:50\
software just please please subscribe you know i I find it very\
54:56\
um refreshing to me honestly that you know it's as someone who's gone through the you know battlefield who's already\
55:02\
gone through all this stuff um you you let your experience kind of speak for yourself um let's say a flight school\
55:08\
does want to kind of you know maybe consult with you they want to say hey you know you because I think by the way for any business if you want to grow\
55:15\
your business um the best way to grow your business is to find someone that has already done what you're trying to\
55:22\
achieve So um you know for me you know I I I'm running a marketing agency and I and I'm\
55:28\
you know we were helping five schools all over the US and what I've tried to do is I work with I have coaches and\
55:34\
mentors that have grown agencies in other spaces maybe in you know plumbing or roofing or something like that but\
55:40\
they went from you know zero zero clients or zero flight schools to hundreds and um I asked them for their\
55:46\
take on it what how they would do let's say Google ads or SEO and things like that i think for flight schools running\
55:53\
a um a flight training operation the best advice I you know that's out there\
55:58\
is to really find someone that has done it has done the things that you've done and I think Gordon here is a prime\
56:03\
example of that so if someone wants to kind of consult with you or use some of the software tools that you have done um\
56:09\
how do we do that how do we um I guess schedule a call with you how do we actually you know implement your system\
56:15\
at what price does it cost to run needle line at my school um maybe you can kind of elaborate with that no happy to i I'd\
56:23\
say we're really easy to find if you go to just needle9.com online uh you'll find our\
56:29\
web page and it has the the general information of the the features many of I've already discussed\
56:36\
um to to really help you understand um how it will impact your operation the\
56:43\
best ways to schedule a demo if you go through the website and you fill out the contact form we'll set up an hour where\
56:51\
we can just talk one-on-one um explain to me what your current challenges are what what are your biggest frustrations\
56:58\
every day and I'll explain to you how we might be able to help some of that might\
57:08\
be you know almost certainly we'll address your frustration because I've\
57:13\
been there myself i know what you're talking about um but more importantly\
57:19\
we'll talk about you know how do you use this effectively you know how can you implement it and train your staff and if\
57:25\
we need to do some you know staff training I've I've done that many times where hey let's get all of your\
57:32\
instructors uh together for an hour and we'll just deep dive into lesson grading\
57:38\
and making sure that your students understand exactly where they're at and how to prepare for the lessons so\
57:45\
they're not wasting your time you know it's it's more than just functionality\
57:50\
um it's about you know incorporation and indoctrination so that's where we're\
57:56\
here to to support you if there's you know really specific expert assistance\
58:03\
that you need oftentimes it's around the financial sector because that's probably one of the most challenging parts of the\
58:10\
business if if you don't come from that background we do have uh real professional experienced accountants\
58:16\
that they can consult on just a a case-byase basis if you need to clean up\
58:23\
your chart of accounts to get the right reporting and the insights that you're looking for we'll spend a couple of\
58:29\
hours with you and and make sure that we set that up for you properly the pricing for Needle 9 we decided to\
58:36\
do a little bit differently because I know especially small operations the\
58:42\
margins are so slim you know you can't afford hundreds of thousands of dollars\
58:48\
for these software subscriptions uh what we wanted to do instead is actually make it free to\
58:55\
flight schools and I I actually mean that there's zero cost to the operation\
59:03\
instead just like Ticketmaster when you go online you buy an concert ticket\
59:08\
there's a small service fee that's tacked on to the invoice and that's for the the ticket master you know making\
59:15\
their their margin off of use of the system uh we do a similar thing a\
59:21\
student checks out an airplane with an instructor they go fly they come back\
59:26\
and check in the invoice is automatically generated based off of your rates and the instructor's time so\
59:34\
if it's $250 invoice for a a normal training flight we'll tack on a dollar\
59:43\
and to date we haven't had a single person bat an eye over a $1 service fee\
59:50\
for you know a $250 instruction event so\
59:55\
the operator collects that service fee as part of just the normal invoicing and then once a week we'll send you a list\
1:00:03\
of here's all of the check-ins that you had for the last seven days um you owe\
1:00:08\
us you know the $36 or whatever it is that you collected from your student and\
1:00:14\
that's it so it's very simple you get full features there's no um add-on\
1:00:21\
charges to integrate QuickBooks or safety management or or training records\
1:00:27\
in fact um we've got a new partnership with Gold Seal so if your students are\
1:00:32\
taking the online ground seal uh school with gold seal it will automatically\
1:00:37\
import all of their training progress into the needle 9 LMS that's all free\
1:00:44\
um so hopefully it's a a a very attractive value proposition to to fly\
1:00:52\
schools out there and um almost more importantly you know we're here to support your business holistically\
1:01:01\
love that um so yeah if you're interested in you know working with Gordon if you're looking at you know\
1:01:06\
potentially solutions for your flight school for operations I think Needle 9 is definitely a good option for you um\
1:01:12\
very it's amazing unique um value proposition here so yeah go to needle9.com um that will help you just\
1:01:19\
to see what it's all about um fill out that contact form get in contact with Gordon's team um they'll schedule a\
1:01:27\
one-on-one with you and kind of see what you're really about and see if they can it's a good fit and it can help um if\
1:01:33\
you choose to run with it i think like like Gordon said it's a dollar per flight which is relatively very low i\
1:01:38\
think uh after talking to a lot of other um similar systems out there you know\
1:01:43\
you can be paying thousands if not tens of thousands a month um you know\
1:01:49\
implementing these software systems at your school and I think you know one of the things that you know as you grow and scale our business is the technology\
1:01:55\
debt you know you don't you want you really want to make sure that you consolidate some of the things that you're doing um that way you can you\
1:02:02\
know save on that overhead and have a bigger bottom line um you know revenue is um what's it called vanity and profit\
1:02:09\
is sanity right so make sure make sure you um have a good profit margin and um you're able to grow your school so I\
1:02:15\
