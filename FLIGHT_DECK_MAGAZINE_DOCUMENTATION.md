## How to Use

### Adding New Magazine Articles

1. Create a new Markdown file in `src/content/magazine/` with the following frontmatter:

```markdown
---
pubDate: "YYYY-MM-DD"
author: "Author Name"
title: "Article Title"
description: "Brief description for SEO and previews"
heroImage: "/path/to/image.webp"
readingTime: 5
category: "Category Name"
tags: ["Tag1", "Tag2", "Tag3"]
issue: "Vol 1, Issue 2"
issueDate: "YYYY-MM-DD"
featured: false
status: "published"
metaTitle: "Optimized Title for SEO"
metaDescription: "Optimized description for SEO (120-160 chars)"
keywords: "keyword1, keyword2, keyword3"
---

Your article content here...
```

2. The article will automatically appear on the magazine index page
3. Articles marked with `featured: true` will appear in the featured section
4. Draft articles (`status: "draft"`) can be previewed using `npm run build:preview`

### SEO Best Practices

- **Title**: Keep under 60 characters
- **Meta Description**: 120-160 characters with a clear CTA
- **Keywords**: Include aviation-specific and magazine-related terms
- **Hero Image**: Use optimized WebP format, descriptive alt text
- **Issue Number**: Use consistent format (e.g., "Vol 1, Issue 3")
- **Categories**: Use consistent category names across articles
- **Tags**: Use 3-5 relevant tags per article

### URL Structure

- Magazine index: `/flight-deck`
- Individual articles: `/flight-deck/article-slug`

### Integration with Existing Systems

The magazine collection integrates seamlessly with:

- SEO utilities (`src/utils/seo.ts`)

- Site navigation (add links to main nav as needed)

## Recommended Workflow
